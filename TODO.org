*** TODO Detect time zone offset in EXIF data
According to Wikipedia the 2.31 version of EXIF will support time-zone
information. Eventually, the application should be able to detect this and
include it in the database records.

: There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus
: rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information have
: been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are:
: "OffsetTime", "OffsetTimeOriginal" and "OffsetTimeDigitized".

*** TODO Rewrite backend code in ReasonML
**** GraphQL portion
[[https://blog.ecliptic.io/a-reasonable-graphql-exploration-part-1-5651f75de497][ecliptic.io part 1]], [[https://blog.ecliptic.io/a-reasonable-graphql-exploration-part-2-3c3b811f7491][part 2]], [[https://blog.ecliptic.io/a-reasonable-graphql-exploration-part-3-b303b375ab23][part 3]], [[https://blog.ecliptic.io/a-reasonable-graphql-followup-192f6ec29550][follow-up]]
- shows how to write the GraphQL backend
- uses Node/Express too
- builds everything up, from types to encoders/decoders
- uses [[https://github.com/glennsl/bs-json][bs-json]] for JSON encode/decode

*** TODO Look at https://github.com/cristianoc/genType for JavaScript interop
*** TODO Consider how to organize webui code from the backend code
Presumably it will all eventually be written in ReasonML, how should the
webui and backend code be separated?

** Documentation
