* TODO

** Node.js Rewrite

- [TODO] Figure out how to use layouts with EJS and express.js
  - apparently EJS uses partials instead of a layout
  - Sails.js somehow manages to have real layouts with EJS
- [TODO] Set the `production` flag in `gulpfile.js` based on environment
- [TODO] Look at https://moment.github.io/luxon/docs/ for a nice date/time library
- [TODO] Maybe use https://github.com/expressjs/csurf for CSRF protection
- [TODO] Consider whether server needs a SIGINT handler (as described in pm2 docs)

** General Items

- [TODO] Need to read `apiUrlPrefix` in Elm code from configuration file
  - currently it is modified at deployment time using `sed`
- [TODO] Look for means of ensuring LevelDB data integrity
  - Look into enabling extra LevelDB checks (`paranoidChecks`, `verifyChecksums`)

  - Recovery is to replace corrupted DB with backup
  - Could just be something that is manually invoked as needed
- [TODO] Support HEIC/HEIF file formats
- [TODO] When performing image manipulations, invoke `sharp.withMetadata()` to preserve metadata
- [TODO] Add a "people" field
