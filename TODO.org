* Action Items
** TODO fork =flutter_tagging_plus= and fix its problems
*** remove =onChanged()= and add =onRemoved()=
*** do not share the list with the caller
*** add spacing between the text field and chips
*** when no chips are present, have an invisible chip that holds that space to prevent movement
*** after selecting a suggestion, focus the text field
*** consider if =Taggable= can be removed, =choose_input_chips= does not have such a thing
** bug: import hangs after ~140 assets
*** seems like Firefox is completely frozen at some point
** bug: selecting a season when year is ~any~ should select the latest year
*** if the year was never set, works, but if year was set to ~Any~ then it doesn't?
** Enable rotating and flipping images from the asset edit page
*** =image= crate supports several filters (flip, rotate, etc)
*** need to recognize that the asset is an image (cannot edit anything else)
*** new graphql query to temporarily apply a set of transformations to an asset
*** new graphql mutation to permanently apply a set of transformations to an asset
*** repository functions for saving/fetching/clearing temporary assets
*** temporary changes may be just the preview image size, cached in memory
*** use case to receive a list of transforms, return url for temporary asset
*** use case to receive a list of transforms, permanently save a new version of asset
*** new version will get a new unique identifier and thereby URL
*** use case will move previous identity into a new field to track old versions
*** web server to serve temporary asset via url
** Add light/dark theme switcher
*** Use =ThemeData= to construct the default light or dark themes
** Fix all the stateful widgets to use the new convention
#+begin_src dart
class TagSelector extends StatefulWidget {
  const TagSelector({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<TagSelector> createState() => _TagSelectorState();
}
#+end_src
** Add date order button on gallery (ascending/descending)
*** the GraphQL operation supports sorting, should use it for something
** Gallery display modes
*** different modes of display
**** responsive grid; images are scaled to fit in a row, with wrapping
***** previously was this way in the Electron-based application
**** grid of just images, maybe 180x180 (a la Apple Photos)
**** grid of images with caption info (300x300, shows title, location, date) (a la PhotoPrism)
**** list of rows, tiny thumbnail (96x96), caption, location, date
**** material has several ~view~ icons that may be appropriate
*** show additional details on mouse hover
** Lightbox style asset browsing
*** Q: would this be a separate screen from the asset details?
*** show large image (scaled to fit?) with date and caption and/or location
**** select from date, filename, tags, location, caption to make up a "description"
**** use whatever fields are not blank to make up a decent amount of text
*** show chevron arrows on left and right to navigate among search results
*** controls appear when mouse moves over asset display, then fade away
** Responsive interface
*** Flutter Folio example app that works well for all screen sizes
**** c.f. https://flutter.gskinner.com
** Quick edit without leaving gallery page
*** On-hover button to display modal to edit certain fields
*** Clicking on asset (i.e. not the button) displays details page
** People versus tags
*** A ~people~ field on asset records might be useful
*** Interface could then show ~Tags~, ~People~, and ~Locations~ for browsing
*** Would require a ~people~ field on asset ingestion page
*** Would need a GraphQL mutation to move a given tag from ~tags~ to ~people~
*** Would need a new index on the ~people~ field
*** Search page would need a new ~people~ field
** Better search controls
*** Simplified controls with selected attributes shown separately
**** See anilist.co search page (https://anilist.co/search/anime)
***** search text input field
***** selectors for genre, year, season, format
***** selections are shown below the row of selectors (prefixed by ~tag~ icon)
***** far right has view option buttons (list, grid, etc)
***** settings-like icon on far right displays dialog with advanced options
**** Text input field with completion of tags and locations
**** Dropdowns to select tag, location, year, season
***** Can only select a single year
***** Can only select a single season (i.e. ~Jan-Mar~, ~Apr-Jun~, ~Jul-Sep~, ~Oct-Dec~)
***** With only year, search within the entire calendar year
***** With only season, search that season of the most recent year
***** With year + season, search that year narrowed to the season
**** Selections are shown below the row of selectors as raised buttons
***** Mousing over selection shows a ~delete~ icon
***** Mousing over the row shows a "Clear All" button
** Deployment issues
*** Consider using =dart:html= to get the current URL vs setting at build time
**** GraphQL client needs the full address of the server
**** However, running in dev mode the url in the browser has a weird port
** Interface improvements
*** reference: https://flutter.github.io/samples/
*** Thumbnail Serving Strategy
**** the frontend can use the image dimensions to compute the aspect ratio
**** with the aspect ratio, frontend can request images of the desired size
**** frontend can ask for images that are N pixels high or M pixels wide, or whatever
***** by leaving one dimension maxed out, the image aspect ratio will be maintained
**** as long as client keeps asking for the same basic size, backend can cache them
**** when generating thumbnail, always use jpeg format so content type is =image/jpeg=
*** evaluate GMail for ideas on navigation, filtering, etc
**** c.f. https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/reply a mail client demo
**** filters (icons w/names) displayed on the left side
**** sidebar on the right for extra features/extensions
**** hamburger icon in upper left toggles filter names vs just icons
**** search bar along the very top
**** waffle icon to navigate to other applications
**** help and settings icons next to waffle
*** browse and search
**** unified search bar (text input field)
***** completion on tags, locations, etc
***** completion list should indicate if entry is a tag, location, etc
***** accepted items shown with ~#~ and ~@~ prefix to indicate tag or location
**** consider where to display file name and media type search fields
*** image gallery paging
**** spring-loaded next-page navigation
***** scroll to the bottom and keep trying to scroll
***** show some indication (e.g. a spinner) that holding will fetch the next page
***** after two seconds or so, navigate to the next page
**** consider other ways of showing lots of results w/o paging
***** look at some examples and packages for ideas on design and implementation
****** handles scrolling and waiting for data: https://pub.dev/packages/pagination_view
****** has dots: https://pub.dev/packages/dot_pagination_swiper
****** can show an error message: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_pagination_helper
****** infinite with limited caching: https://pub.dev/packages/infinite_pagination
****** supports various views: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_paginator
**** consider how to display pages continuously (a la infinite list)
***** would keep several pages in the widget tree at one time
***** scrolling would drop a page widget from the tree, and add a new one
***** when fetching a new page, the page widget would show a progress indicator
***** the "dropped" pages would be changed to consist of placeholders to free memory
**** using carousel style navigation arrows?
*** asset detail page
**** display the date and caption prominently
**** display the other details using a smaller font
**** display select information from EXIF metadata (e.g. camera)
*** quick editing on browse page
**** use =ExpansionPanel= for thumbnail caption that allows editing common fields
*** navigation between screens
**** do not want to have to build all of the screens at the same time, probably
**** can add actions to the =Appbar= with an overflow popup menu button
***** the popup menu button would be the navigation selector
***** the other actions would be appropriate to the current screen
**** maybe use =TabBar=
**** maybe use =BottomNavigationBar=
*** error handling
**** many screens/widgets just display a message without any means of recovery
**** see any of the widgets using bloc providers and how they become useless upon error
**** flutter allows for a custom error handler (i.e. override the ugly red screen)
*** navigation rail for filtering gallery view
**** c.f. https://pub.dev/packages/navigation_rail
**** Nextcloud has a side bar for photos with these options:
***** Photos
***** Videos
***** Albums
***** People
***** Favorites
***** On this day
***** Tags
***** Locations
*** use =RichText= widget to style the captions (e.g. make tags bold)
*** tags in caption could be "gesture sensitive" (i.e. clickable) to show assets with that tag
*** can use =DataTable= to display labeled data (like asset details, metadata)
*** use pointer enter/exit events to start playing a video in place
** Timeline style display for all assets
*** without any selectors, just show most recent going back in time
*** c.f. https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_timeline
*** PhotoPrism has a ~calendar~ view that shows months of years in random order with a (random?) thumbnail
** Known Issues
*** clicking on portrait avi(?) shows widened image and page does not scroll to show details
*** preview of small images makes them large; should serve original size for smaller images
*** graphql errors are handled poorly everywhere
*** RocksDB fails with ~too many open files~ when uploading numerous files
#+BEGIN_SRC
thread 'actix-web' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error {
 message: "IO error: While open a file for appending: tmp/rocksdb/000733.sst: Too many open files"
}', src/main.rs:88:71
#+END_SRC
** Import screen improvements
*** small button to go directly to asset details/edit page
*** hover over an image to show a larger version
*** hover over a video to start playing it
** Attribute management
*** screen for showing all tags, locations, years, with count values
**** selecting a tag or location offers a rename function
**** selecting multiple tags/locations offers option to remove from all assets
** Bulk edit
*** need to set the custom date on many assets at once
*** Short term solution akin to perkeep/photoprism web interface
**** hover over thumbnail, shows checkbox in the corner
**** click on the checkbox to select the asset
**** once selected, the action popup menu becomes enabled
***** where should the popup menu live?
****** could be in the appbar actions area
****** photoprism adds a FAB that shows the selected count
**** detailed analysis of perkeep tagging
***** user clicks on selection button overlay on asset thumbnail
***** sidebar appears (image gallery shrinks to accomodate)
***** text field for adding new (comma-separated) tags
***** shows superset of all tags on all selected assets as chips
***** indicates those tags that are on _all_ selected assets by filling in with color
***** clicking on an unfilled tag will apply it to all selected assets
***** tags can be removed via ~X~ button attached to tag
*** More sophisticated edits, similar to JIRA
**** start by browsing/searching for assets
**** use the selection checkbox on each asset to select
**** offer a "select all" operation
**** access the operation popup menu to edit selected items
**** menu contains item to perform a bulk edit
**** navigates to screen with form for changing multiple properties
***** set a custom date
***** add a location
***** remove a location
***** rename a location
***** add a tag
***** remove a tag
***** rename a tag
***** set caption
***** change media type
** Advanced Search
*** TODO Add support for searching by mimetype
*** TODO Begin search when user pauses typing
**** Use =debounceTime= operator in RxDart with BLoC state for this
*** TODO Compute Levenshtein distance when comparing strings
**** that is, try to adjust for misspells and minor variations
*** TODO Support advanced queries using Google-style operators
**** c.f. https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en
**** move perkeep style query support from mujina to tanuki
**** webui needs an "advanced" tab/link selector on the search page
**** =is:image= and similar to filter by media type
**** =with:<name>= to filter by people (need to know the people though)
**** =AND= and =OR= operators and grouping with parentheses
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no tags
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no location
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no caption
*** TODO Support searching the caption text
**** likely would involve a full table scan
*** TODO searching for images by dimensions (~pano~, ~landscape~, ~portrait~)
*** TODO searching for images based on type (~selfie~, ~screen shot~)
*** TODO searching assets by metadata values (=meta:exif:field=value=)
*** TODO search for images similar to a selected image (a la geeqie)
*** TODO search for images taken with certain cameras
** Schema Growth
*** ML will introduce new fields, like ~labels~ and ~keywords~
*** Geolocation will introduce new data, like GPS coordinates
*** Plan ahead for hierarchial location data (e.g. USA -> California -> Castro Valley -> our home)
*** Plan ahead for hierarchical categories: People -> Friends -> School
*** Customer user-provided metadata will need a place to live
*** Perhaps use records with different key prefixes
**** =metadata/= for user-provided name/value pairs
**** =location/= for location details
**** =decoration/= for ML added values
*** Design solution to database migrations
**** start planning on how to handle data(base) migrations
**** may be a good idea to introduce "metadata" records for assets
***** use a =metadata/= prefix with the id of the asset
***** can hold all sorts of additional information without cluttering the asset
***** should be some form of dictionary to keep things flexible
**** maintain an uber record for tracking database version
**** also the serde library is quite flexible with adding/removing fields
** Data Format Support
*** Read and display descriptions from asset metadata (IPTC ~Description~)
*** Auto-populate missing fields on load
**** when loading an asset, detect missing data (e.g. no original time)
**** try reading the data from the asset and save to the asset record
**** in the future, as more data formats are supported, can fill in the blanks
*** Read other metadata formats
**** XMP
**** IPTC
*** TODO support HEIF images
**** c.f. https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/
***** AV1 is the free alternative to encumbered HEVC
***** there are some crates for avif
**** HEIF is an image file format employing HEVC (h.265) image coding
**** https://crates.io/crates/libheif-rs (MIT)
**** https://crates.io/crates/libvips (MIT) reads/writes HEIF
***** this library easily crashes with a segmentation fault
**** https://github.com/oussama/libheif-rs (MIT)
**** https://crates.io/crates/kamadak-exif (BSD) reads metadata
*** Support audio formats
**** get audio playback working
**** read =ID3= tags in audio files
*** TODO Detect time zone offset in EXIF data
According to Wikipedia the 2.31 version of EXIF will support time-zone
information. Eventually, the application should be able to detect this and
include it in the database records.

: There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus
: rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information have
: been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are:
: "OffsetTime", "OffsetTimeOriginal" and "OffsetTimeDigitized".

*** TODO Display thumbnails for PDF files
*** TODO Read metadata from PDF files
**** probably has a creation date or some sort
*** TODO Show the =AAE= files as plain text (they are xml)
*** TODO Detect if an image is a "portrait" using metadata
*** TODO Display asset metadata when showing asset details
**** e.g. TIFF, EXIF, JFIF, IPTC
*** TODO Render Markdown as HTML in a scrollable view
*** TODO Display anything textual in a scrollable text area
*** Thumbnails for non-images
**** PhotoPrism generates suitable thumbnails for other kinds of files, saves them to disk
*** Reference
**** EXIF: https://www.media.mit.edu/pia/Research/deepview/exif.html
** Geolocation
*** Extract location information from images
**** write a data migration to process existing assets
**** existing location values should be stored in a "label" field
**** exact location information would be stored separate from label
**** c.f. https://github.com/google/open-location-code/wiki/Evaluation-of-Location-Encoding-Systems
**** c.f. https://www.osgeo.org for some information, resources
*** Map display with locations of photos taken
**** [[https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/][Google Maps]]
- customer uses their own API key, sets in preferences
- for =testing= account: =AIzaSyAI73udKC3KVk6aIBqOjSqSv6PEQ0qd638=
**** [[https://mariusandra.github.io/pigeon-maps/][Pigeon Maps]]
- Uses data from OpenStreetMap, Wikimedia for the tiles
** Machine learning
*** TensorFlow Hub: https://tfhub.dev
*** https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/
*** PhotoPrism applies a bunch of keywords to assets, but only one "label"
**** e.g. a "Sheep" label with keywords "animal, grass, grasslands, green"
*** ML to identify objects, people, etc in photos
**** ML recognizes the subject (dog, cat, person, etc)
**** PhotoPrism supports "automated tagging based on Google TensorFlow"
**** OpenCV for face recognition
***** consider licensing commercial library for this
*** ML to rank photos on various qualities
**** c.f. https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/
**** ML assigns scores on aesthetics, interest, etc
** Asset organization
*** Events
**** e.g. school performances, vacations
**** Means of assigning assets to a particular event
**** Browsing by events
*** Albums
**** i.e. organize assets by project, subject, event
**** Apple Photos has ~smart~ albums
***** assets taken around the same time, place
**** save search results as a new album
*** Personal collections
**** that is, sets of assets normally visible to just one person
*** Multiple libraries (like Apple Photos)
** Mobile web support
*** Progressive Web App support in Flutter is coming as of 2020/04
*** Use PWA to get app-like behavior on mobile devices
** Desktop app
*** macOS: cocoapods and M1 support is pending a bug fix
**** c.f. https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/9907
*** macOS: need an entitlement? to play videos using =video_player=
*** macOS: likely need to add entitlement for =com.apple.security.network.server=
**** entitlements are part of the app signing process, allowing apps certain abilities
**** c.f. https://flutter.dev/desktop#entitlements-and-the-app-sandbox
*** Need setup for configuration system
**** properties
***** path for database files
***** path for where file uploads go temporarily
***** path for where assets are stored
**** default configuration setup at build-time
***** would be nice to have something like Dart's =environment_config=
****** could use =build.rs= to generate an environment config
******* then load that in =main.rs= to get everything into memory
***** https://github.com/andoriyu/uclicious (BSD)
***** https://github.com/mehcode/config-rs (MIT)
**** screen for configuring the settings
*** Showing the licenses/about dialog
**** use the Flutter =AboutDialog= widget
**** c.f. "licenses" on https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/faq for details
** Mobile app
*** Will likely need the Flutter =AboutDialog= to show legalese for app stores
*** Use [[https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker][image_picker]] to allow user to select images from photo library
*** Allow downloading images and such to the phone for offline browsing
*** Upload while away from home
**** mobile app with upload to a "drop box", backend then retrieves those (on a schedule?)
**** evaluate [[https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole][magic-wormhole]] as a means of transferring directly to the home computer
** Editing Images
*** Keep track of the asset revisions
*** Allow user to select the primary version (e.g. undo)
*** rotate, flip, spin, crop
*** apply common filters
**** c.f. https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon
*** open asset in external program in temporary file
**** easy-to-use app: https://github.com/robaho/seashore
** Data Integrity
*** Guard against concurrent modifications
**** consider how to manage multiple users making changes
**** e.g. two people trying to update the same set of recent imports
**** e.g. two people trying to edit the same asset
**** this is known as the ~lost update~ problem
**** usually managed with a revision number on the record
***** updates must include the revision number; if mismatch, raise error
***** HTTP uses the =ETag= value and the =If-Match= header for this purpose
**** maybe keep an edit history or revision number in separate records
*** Expose data integrity checks in frontend
**** consider if using GraphQL subscriptions would make sense
***** would return each asset id and success bool or list of error codes
***** results would be returned one at a time for the frontend to show progress
***** the error codes would be encoded as GraphQL enums
**** add an option to purge bad records
***** errors of type base64, utf8, missing are not recoverable
**** find files for which there are no documents
*** Should have automated backups of the database
**** every M operations or T minutes/hours/days
*** Add controls for dumping and loading the database
**** provides another mechanism for backup
**** power users could perform large bulk edits of data
** Bulk Export
*** Easy selection and export of multiple images
**** Selection process
***** Maybe show selection icon thingy on hover, click to select
****** use =Stack= with =Align= and a flat button
***** Maybe shift-click to select by thumbnails
**** Export process
***** Maybe app bar has "export" feature to export selected assets
***** Maybe action panel appears when there are selections
***** Show "file save" dialog to choose local file path
***** Save assets using their unique filename
**** Web support is lacking
***** JS has a =showSaveFilePicker()= but seems like =dart:html= does not expose this API
** Performance
*** measure and improve the thumbnail serving
**** thoughts on image crate vs magick-rust vs node.js
***** no idea why image crate appears to be faster than magick-rust
***** priming the cache helps actix a great deal because of its concurrency
***** because actix handles many requests concurrently, it creates the same thumbnail many times over
***** node.js seems fast because it creates thumbnail on first request; it processes requests serially
***** however, node.js is 10 times slower than actix in raw performance
***** actix is probably handling 10 times as many requests concurrently
**** consider caching in memory or on disk
***** unbound caching on disk will consume space forever
***** should have an on-disk LRU cache with a set capacity
**** test images for measurements

*** consider if caching search results will improve responsiveness
**** could return a query code to the caller in search meta
**** caller returns that code in the next query to access the cache
**** in this way, the results for a particular query can be cached reliably
**** eventually cached search results need to be pruned
**** RocksDB by default has a block cache of 8mb in 16 shards of 512kb
**** also consider that any caching should live in the data source
*** consider if filtering can be done "in the database" somehow
**** database queries should probably take a filter closure
**** database functions iterate the results, applying the filter
**** the remaining results are then collecting into a vector

**** look into getting some sort of certification to bypass SmartScreen
***** c.f. https://getimageview.net/2020/06/02/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-is-hurting-independent-developers/
**** ensure AVI support works fully
***** display thumbnails and play video
***** extract original date/time if available
**** ensure support for popular image formats (whatever is popular on Windows)
***** BMP (Windows Bitmap)
*** Desktop application combined with the server
*** Building the product (build automation)
**** Requirements
***** Consistent builds
***** Need this for building the application, not compiling code
****** dart, flutter, and rust/cargo all know how to compile code
****** need a process to assemble the application deliverable
***** Should support Rust, Dart, Flutter
***** Should support macOS, Windows
***** Likely need a build machine for each target (mac, windows)
***** Contenders
******* https://bazel.build
******* https://please.build
******* https://jenkins.io
******* https://www.buildbot.net
***** Bazel
****** supports all major platforms
****** a very sophisticated replacement for =make=
****** not appropriate for replacing =cargo= or =flutter build=
****** dart: https://github.com/cbracken/rules_dart
****** rust: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust
****** rust: https://github.com/google/cargo-raze
******* tries to replace cargo to get benefits of bazel
*** Branding: name, logo
*** Tracking issues and releases on a schedule (SCM)
**** Consider if using GitLab (in a container) would be helpful
***** c.f. https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/
** Architecture Review
*** Flutter/Rust bridge, call Rust from Dart
**** c.f. https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge
**** c.f. https://www.zaynetro.com/post/flutter-rust-bridge-2023/
*** Rewrite application in Dart
**** database: https://github.com/isar/isar
***** supports composite indices, filters, sorting
*** Alternative to actix might be axum (https://crates.io/crates/axum)
*** Alternative to running HTTP server
**** Use a socket file
**** Link Dart code to Rust using FFI
*** Asynchronous
**** Will need to start using =async/await= as more libraries return =Future=
**** Use of actix means that tokio runtime is already in place
*** Large file upload
**** split file into chunks, upload one-by-one, showing progress
***** default to 8MB chunks, most images will be smaller than that
*** GraphQL server
**** consider https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql as alternative to juniper
***** handles multipart requests (file uploads)
***** provides actix-web integration
