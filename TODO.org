- building the ReasonReact GraphQL client

**** DONE Get tag fetching working
**** DONE Organize the code to display the home page
**** TODO Use reductive for the application state management
***** TODO Add ="reductive": "nlfiedler/reductive#render"= to =package.json=
***** TODO Add ="reductive"= to ="bs-dependencies"= in =bsconfig.json=
***** TODO Copy =reduxThunk.re= from reductive examples
***** TODO Copy =middleware.re= from reductive examples
***** TODO Leverage my todomvc example as a starting point
**** Use reductive to hold non-GraphQL values, Apollo is caching already
***** What goes in reducer components
- route?
- pageNumber
- edit form
- search form
- showing all tags
- showing all locations
- upload filename

***** What goes in reductive
- selected tag values
- selected location values
- selected years values
- saved search inputs

***** What lives in apollo cache
- tags
- locations
- years
- asset list
- asset details

**** TODO Use Reason's router instead of Elm navigator
**** TODO Get basic search form working
**** TODO Get asset fetching working
**** TODO Get asset update working
**** TODO Get asset upload working
***** To detect drag support (in JS): ='draggable' in document.createElement('span')=

*** TODO URI path for thumbnails and such should be return in GraphQL data
The front-end should not have to know how to construct the URI path for the
assets, thumbnails, etc. Host and port _cannot_ be in the GraphQL data since
the backend does not know how the front-end is addressing it.

*** TODO Rewrite backend code on ReasonML
**** GraphQL portion

- shows how to write the GraphQL backend
- uses Node/Express too
- builds everything up, from types to encoders/decoders
- uses [[https://github.com/glennsl/bs-json][bs-json]] for JSON encode/decode

*** TODO Asset preview should show the media type
*** TODO Debounce the form input validation (i.e. asset edit and search forms)
*** TODO Can gulp-nodemon be removed/replaced? introduces several vulnerabilities
**** Or fork the repo and fix the issue
*** TODO Support searching the caption text
*** TODO Support wildcards in filename, mimetype (others?)
*** TODO Extract exact location information from images [0/4]
- [ ] Write a data migration to process existing assets
- [ ] Incoming needs to extract this information for new assets
- [ ] Existing location values should be stored in "label" field
- [ ] Exact location information should be stored separate from label

*** TODO Need a query to find image assets whose orientation is incorrect/unknown
*** TODO Asset preview page shows a broken link, should show placeholder image
*** TODO Thumbnail size cache population is noticably slow when selecting many assets
*** TODO When performing image manipulations, invoke `sharp.withMetadata()` to preserve metadata
*** TODO Use a webview to preview Markdown generated as HTML
*** TODO Read [[https://github.com/MtDalPizzol/pouchdb-permissions][pouchdb-permissions]] for possible use in user/groups access
*** TODO Detect time zone offset in EXIF data
According to Wikipedia the 2.31 version of EXIF will support time-zone
information. Eventually, the application should be able to detect this and
include it in the database records.

: There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus
: rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information have
: been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are:
: "OffsetTime", "OffsetTimeOriginal" and "OffsetTimeDigitized".

** Documentation
*** Case Sensitivity
- Data is stored as entered (case preservative)
- Attribute lists are all lowercased
- Search is always case insensitive

*** Date/Time values
- Uses 24 hour clock, displays using local time zone, stored as UTC
