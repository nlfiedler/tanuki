***** intentionally skips the creation time fields
*** DONE large file import (or simply direct file import)
**** photoprism has an ~import~ folder and command to bring in assets
**** on upload screen, provide button to process anything sitting in ~uploads~ directory
**** guess the media type, create a record, move file into place
**** DONE write a new usecase that invokes =ImportAsset=
***** test that it ignores dot files and directories
**** DONE write a new GraphQL mutation that invokes the new usecase
***** return the number of assets processed
**** DONE add the button on upload screen to invoke GraphQL mutation
***** display the results (number of assets)
*** DONE imports screen should first sort results by filename
*** DONE need to make sure the other AVI files in shared are really AVI files
**** rename the files before importing
**** they all check out as proper RIFF encoded AVI files
*** DONE extension repair should replace the extension, not append
*** DONE some of the supposed avi files are QuickTime
**** probably need to fix the media type by hand and then run a repair
**** they are probably the ones that got "fixed" a week ago
***** their names were probably wrong but the media type was correct?
**** these are all quicktime videos with non-trivial length
***** does play in Finder
***** does download via link
***** does not play in Firefox
***** does not play in Safari
***** changing the media type fixes it for Safari
**** these have been fixed, however they are very short
***** does not load properly in Firefox
***** displays normally in Safari, shows as 0 seconds long

** [#C] Prepare for Christmas calendar
*** easy selection and export of images
**** Selection process
***** Maybe show selection icon thingy on hover, click to select
***** Maybe shift-click to select by thumbnails
**** Export process
***** Maybe main menu has "export" feature to export selected assets
***** Maybe action panel appears when there are selections
***** Show "file save" dialog to choose local file path
***** Save assets using their unique filename
** [#B] New Interface
*** Use Clean Architecture
**** define the features
***** browse
***** import
***** export
***** edit
*** Thumbnail Serving Strategy
**** capture the image/video dimensions during import, save to asset record
***** a larger asset record in CBOR format is ~260 bytes, a few more bytes is okay
***** in PouchDB, each record takes almost exactly 1 kilobyte
***** use =u32= for each dimension (should be more than enough)
**** on import, ensure asset identifier ends with correct media type extension
***** if provided filename does not end in the correct extension, append it
****** use the provided media type to know what extension to add
***** this ensures correct guessing of media type when making thumbnails
***** n.b. all thumbnails and previews are image/jpeg anyway so this is not necessary
***** if, someday, the provided media type is "unknown", then use mime sniffer
***** c.f. https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org
***** c.f. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/How_Mozilla_determines_MIME_Types
***** c.f. https://github.com/flier/rust-mime-sniffer
**** the frontend can use the image dimensions to compute the aspect ratio
**** with the aspect ratio, frontend can request images of the desired size
**** frontend can ask for images that are N pixels high or M pixels wide, or whatever
***** by leaving one dimension maxed out, the image aspect ratio will be maintained
**** as long as client keeps asking for the same basic size, backend can cache them
**** when generating thumbnail, always use jpeg format so content type is =image/jpeg=

*** TODO Improve User Experience
**** browse and search
***** [reorganize this section]
***** unify the two pages into one
***** with the "crane" like selectors, the search is just another row of inputs
***** "crane" (flutter gallery sample) style input fields at the top
****** see the "crane" flutter gallery sample for the basic layout and appearance
****** use input fields with small icons on the left and drop-down button on the right
****** typing into the field will perform completion
****** clicking on the drop-down will offer selection of attributes
****** once entered or selected, input fields show active selectors
****** maybe have a small x to deactive active selectors
****** can also remove selectors by backspacing
***** header with several rows for entering and showing selectors
****** one row for tags, another for locations, date range, etc
****** each row starts with a label, e.g. ~Tags~
****** after the label, an input field (show just an underline, rather than a box)
****** typing into the input field will offer completion of tags, etc
****** once entered, the selector is appended to the row, after the input field
****** each label has a ~delete~ button to remove it from the list
***** that is, normally the second row is collapsed, but clicking a button expands it
***** the second row would have the date range, file name, and media type
***** look at flutter form builder "chips input" which has suggestion support
***** flutter form build also has a "type ahead" text input with suggestion support
***** try using the date range picker function in material instead of a list of years
****** flutter form builder also has a date range picker
****** c.f. https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showDatePicker.html
**** image gallery paging
***** consider other ways of showing lots of results w/o paging
****** look at some examples and packages for ideas on design and implementation
******* handles scrolling and waiting for data: https://pub.dev/packages/pagination_view
******* has dots: https://pub.dev/packages/dot_pagination_swiper
******* can show an error message: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_pagination_helper
******* infinite with limited caching: https://pub.dev/packages/infinite_pagination
******* supports various views: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_paginator
***** consider how to display pages continuously (a la infinite list)
****** would keep several pages in the widget tree at one time
****** scrolling would drop a page widget from the tree, and add a new one
****** when fetching a new page, the page widget would show a progress indicator
****** the "dropped" pages would be changed to consist of placeholders to free memory
***** using carousel style navigation arrows?
***** small dots instead of large buttons with numbers in them?
***** still good to have a quick way to jump anywhere in the set of results
**** quick import
***** drag/drop and/or file open to add lots of assets
***** immediately import everything to the backend
***** show progress and display thumbnails as assets are successfully imported
***** switch to the "recent imports" screen showing just these new assets
***** user selects multiple assets and applies tags and locations to them
***** click on an asset to enter a caption in place (without leaving the gallery view)
***** hover over an asset to show a larger version
****** for image, expand temporarily in place
****** for video, start playing it
**** image gallery display
***** different modes of display
****** grid of just images, maybe 180x180 (a la Apple Photos)
****** grid of images with caption info (300x300, shows title, location, date) (a la PhotoPrism)
****** list of rows, tiny thumbnail (96x96), title, location, date, likes
****** material has several ~view~ icons that may be appropriate
***** show selectors for months of the year to jump to that time range
****** eventually this selector needs to consider the sort field and order
****** could use a navigation rail for this (https://pub.dev/packages/navigation_rail)
***** show additional details on mouse hover
***** button in corner of thumbnail to select assets to edit, download, etc
**** asset detail page
***** display the date and caption prominently
***** display the other details using a smaller format
***** seems popular to show the gallery items as small thumbnails along the top (horizontally scrollable)
***** have chevron buttons on both sides to navigate through gallery items (e.g. "lightbox")
***** display location as a city/country pair
***** display select information from EXIF metadata (e.g. camera)
***** add a button to download the raw asset
**** screen for showing all tags and locations, with count values
***** selecting one offers a rename function
***** selecting multiple offers option to remove from all assets
**** quick editing on browse page
***** use =ExpansionPanel= for thumbnail caption that allows editing common fields
**** navigation between sceens
***** do not want to have to build all of the screens at the same time, probably
***** can add actions to the =Appbar= with an overflow popup menu button
****** the popup menu button would be the navigation selector
****** the other actions would be appropriate to the current screen
***** maybe use =TabBar=
***** maybe use =BottomNavigationBar=
**** timeline style display for all assets
***** without any selectors, just show most recent going back in time
***** c.f. https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_timeline
**** navigation rail for filtering gallery view
***** c.f. https://pub.dev/packages/navigation_rail
***** maybe selectors for "portrait", "selfie", that kind of thing
**** flutter allows for a custom error handler (i.e. override the ugly red screen)
*** ideas and widget usage
**** Look at the Flutter "Gallery" app ("crane") for a pretty example
***** gently rounded image corners
***** gallery background has rounded corners
***** pleasing captions
***** interesting not-quite-grid (column oriented) arrangement
***** selectors across the top
***** floating ~Back~ button at the bottom left
**** Consider how to have a "light" and "dark" mode
**** Look for the =video_player= web plugin for playing video in webui
**** use =RichText= widget to style the captions (e.g. make tags bold)
**** tags in caption could be "gesture sensitive" (i.e. clickable) to show assets with that tag
**** paging list view with fetching logic: https://pub.dev/packages/uic
**** use =semanticLabel= on =Image= for accessibility
**** =FutureBuilder= for showing things that load asynchronously
**** use =SliverAppBar= in place of =AppBar=, it will shrink when content is scrolled
***** could be a good way to keep controls above scrolling content
**** use =FadeInImage= to show a placeholder while loading a remote image
**** maybe use =Hero= to animate/transition from image gallery to a single image
***** click on item in a list/grid and it expands to the details page
**** can use =DataTable= to display labeled data (like asset details, metadata)
**** use pointer enter/exit events to start playing a video in place
** Known Issues
*** flutter form builder
**** chips input keyboard focus: https://github.com/danvick/flutter_form_builder/issues/313
** Bulk edit
*** need to set the custom date on many assets at once
*** Short term solution akin to perkeep/photoprism web interface
**** hover over thumbnail, shows checkbox in the corner
**** click on the checkbox to select the asset
**** once selected, the action popup menu becomes enabled
***** where should the popup menu live?
****** could be in the appbar actions area
****** photoprism adds a FAB that shows the selected count
*** More sophisticated edits, similar to JIRA
**** start by browsing/searching for assets
**** use the selection checkbox on each asset to select
**** offer a "select all" operation
**** access the operation popup menu to edit selected items
**** menu contains item to perform a bulk edit
**** navigates to screen with form for changing multiple properties
***** set a custom date
***** add a location
***** remove a location
***** rename a location
***** add a tag
***** remove a tag
***** rename a tag
***** set caption
***** change media type
** Asynchronous
*** Will need to start using =async/await= as more libraries return =Future=
*** Use of actix means that tokio runtime is already in place
** Search Improvements
*** TODO Begin search when user pauses typing
**** Use =debounceTime= operator in RxDart with BLoC state for this
*** TODO Support advanced queries using Google-style operators
**** c.f. https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en
**** move perkeep style query support from mujina to tanuki
**** webui needs an "advanced" tab/link selector on the search page
**** =is:image= and similar to filter by media type
**** =with:<name>= to filter by people (need to know the people though)
**** =AND= and =OR= operators and grouping with parentheses
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no tags at all
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no location at all
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no caption at all
*** TODO Support searching the caption text
**** likely would involve a full table scan
*** TODO Support wildcards in filename, mimetype (others?)
**** likely would involve a full table scan
*** TODO searching for images by dimensions (~pano~, ~landscape~, ~portrait~)
*** TODO searching assets by metadata values (=meta:exif:field=value=)
*** TODO search for images similar to a selected image (a la geeqie)
*** TODO search for images taken with certain cameras
** Schema Growth
*** ML will introduce new fields, like ~labels~ and ~keywords~
*** Geolocation will introduce new data, like GPS coordinates
*** Plan ahead for hierarchial location data (e.g. USA -> California -> Castro Valley -> our home)
*** Plan ahead for hierarchical categories: People -> Friends -> School
*** Customer user-provided metadata will need a place to live
*** Perhaps use records with different key prefixes
**** =metadata/= for user-provided name/value pairs
**** =location/= for location details
**** =decoration/= for ML added values
*** Design solution to database migrations
**** start planning on how to handle data(base) migrations
**** may be a good idea to introduce "metadata" records for assets
***** use a =metadata/= prefix with the id of the asset
***** can hold all sorts of additional information without cluttering the asset
***** should be some form of dictionary to keep things flexible
**** maintain an uber record for tracking database version
**** also the serde library is quite flexible with adding/removing fields
** Data Format Support
*** Read and display descriptions from asset metadata (IPTC ~Description~)
*** Auto-populate missing fields on load
**** when loading an asset, detect missing data (e.g. no original time)
**** try reading the data from the asset and save to the asset record
**** in the future, as more data formats are supported, can fill in the blanks
*** Read other metadata formats
**** XMP
**** IPTC
*** TODO support HEIF images
**** c.f. https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/
***** AV1 is the free alternative to encumbered HEVC
***** there are some crates for avif
**** HEIF is an image file format employing HEVC (h.265) image coding
**** https://crates.io/crates/libvips (MIT) reads/writes HEIF
***** this library easily crashes with a segmentation fault
**** https://github.com/oussama/libheif-rs (MIT)
**** https://crates.io/crates/kamadak-exif (BSD) reads metadata
*** Support audio formats
**** get audio playback working
**** read =ID3= tags in audio files
*** TODO Detect time zone offset in EXIF data
According to Wikipedia the 2.31 version of EXIF will support time-zone
information. Eventually, the application should be able to detect this and
include it in the database records.

: There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus
: rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information have
: been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are:
: "OffsetTime", "OffsetTimeOriginal" and "OffsetTimeDigitized".

*** TODO Display thumbnails for PDF files
*** TODO Read metadata from PDF files
**** probably has a creation date or some sort
*** TODO Show the =AAE= files as plain text (they are xml)
*** TODO Detect if an image is a "portrait" using metadata
*** TODO Display asset metadata when showing asset details
**** e.g. TIFF, EXIF, JFIF, IPTC
*** TODO Render Markdown as HTML in a scrollable view
*** TODO Display anything textual in a scrollable text area
*** Thumbnails for non-images
**** PhotoPrism generates suitable thumbnails for other kinds of files, saves them to disk
*** Reference
**** EXIF: https://www.media.mit.edu/pia/Research/deepview/exif.html
** Geolocation
*** Extract location information from images
**** write a data migration to process existing assets
**** existing location values should be stored in a "label" field
**** exact location information would be stored separate from label
**** c.f. https://github.com/google/open-location-code/wiki/Evaluation-of-Location-Encoding-Systems
**** c.f. https://www.osgeo.org for some information, resources
*** Map display with locations of photos taken
**** [[https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/][Google Maps]]
- customer uses their own API key, sets in preferences
- for =testing= account: =AIzaSyAI73udKC3KVk6aIBqOjSqSv6PEQ0qd638=
**** [[https://mariusandra.github.io/pigeon-maps/][Pigeon Maps]]
- Uses data from OpenStreetMap, Wikimedia for the tiles
** Machine learning
*** TensorFlow Hub: https://tfhub.dev
*** https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/
*** PhotoPrism applies a bunch of keywords to assets, but only one "label"
**** e.g. a "Sheep" label with keywords "animal, grass, grasslands, green"
*** ML to identify objects, people, etc in photos
**** ML recognizes the subject (dog, cat, person, etc)
**** PhotoPrism supports "automated tagging based on Google TensorFlow"
**** OpenCV for face recognition
***** consider licensing commercial library for this
*** ML to rank photos on various qualities
**** c.f. https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/
**** ML assigns scores on aesthetics, interest, etc
** Asset organization
*** Albums
**** i.e. organize assets by project, subject, event
**** Apple Photos has ~smart~ albums
***** assets taken around the same time, place
**** save search results as a new album
*** Personal collections
**** that is, sets of assets normally visible to just one person
*** Multiple libraries (like Apple Photos)
** Mobile web support
*** Progressive Web App support in Flutter is coming as of 2020/04
*** Use PWA to get app-like behavior on mobile devices
*** Look for package (like image_picker) that enables user to select photos to upload
** Desktop app
*** Need setup for configuration system
**** properties
***** path for database files
***** path for where file uploads go temporarily
***** path for where assets are stored
**** default configuration setup at build-time
***** would be nice to have something like Dart's =environment_config=
****** could use =build.rs= to generate an environment config
******* then load that in =main.rs= to get everything into memory
***** https://github.com/andoriyu/uclicious (BSD)
***** https://github.com/mehcode/config-rs (MIT)
**** screen for configuring the settings
*** Showing the licenses/about dialog
**** use the Flutter =AboutDialog= widget
**** c.f. "licenses" on https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/faq for details
** Mobile app
*** Will likely need the Flutter =AboutDialog= to show legalese for app stores
*** Use [[https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker][image_picker]] to allow user to select images from photo library
*** Upload while away from home
**** mobile app with upload to a "drop box", backend then retrieves those (on a schedule?)
**** evaluate [[https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole][magic-wormhole]] as a means of transferring directly to the home computer
** Editing Images
*** Keep track of the asset revisions
*** Allow user to select the primary version (e.g. undo)
*** rotate, flip, flop, crop
*** apply common filters
**** c.f. https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon
*** open asset in external program in temporary file
** Data Integrity
*** Guard against concurrent modifications
**** consider how to manage multiple users making changes
**** e.g. two people trying to update the same set of recent imports
**** e.g. two people trying to edit the same asset
**** this is known as the ~lost update~ problem
**** usually managed with a revision number on the record
***** updates must include the revision number; if mismatch, raise error
***** HTTP uses the =ETag= value and the =If-Match= header for this purpose
**** maybe keep an edit history or revision number in separate records
*** Expose data integrity checks in frontend
**** consider if using GraphQL subscriptions would make sense
***** would return each asset id and success bool or list of error codes
***** results would be returned one at a time for the frontend to show progress
***** the error codes would be encoded as GraphQL enums
**** add an option to purge bad records
***** errors of type base64, utf8, missing are not recoverable
**** find files for which there are no documents
*** Should have automated backups of the database
**** every M operations or T minutes/hours/days
*** Add controls for dumping and loading the database
**** provides another mechanism for backup
**** power users could perform large bulk edits of data
** Performance
*** measure and improve the thumbnail serving
**** thoughts on image crate vs magick-rust vs node.js
***** no idea why image crate appears to be faster than magick-rust
***** priming the cache helps actix a great deal because of its concurrency
***** because actix handles many requests concurrently, it creates the same thumbnail many times over
***** node.js seems fast because it creates thumbnail on first request; it processes requests serially
***** however, node.js is 10 times slower than actix in raw performance
***** actix is probably handling 10 times as many requests concurrently
**** consider caching in memory or on disk
***** unbound caching on disk will consume space forever
***** should have an on-disk LRU cache with a set capacity
**** test images for measurements

*** consider if caching search results will improve responsiveness
**** could return a query code to the caller in search meta
**** caller returns that code in the next query to access the cache
**** in this way, the results for a particular query can be cached reliably
**** eventually cached search results need to be pruned
**** RocksDB by default has a block cache of 8mb in 16 shards of 512kb
**** also consider that any caching should live in the data source
*** consider if filtering can be done "in the database" somehow
**** database queries should probably take a filter closure
**** database functions iterate the results, applying the filter
**** the remaining results are then collecting into a vector
** First Hour
*** Initial help screen when there is zero content
*** Describe elements of the home page (e.g. interactive tutorial)
*** Open a web page with helpful first steps
** Product Development
*** Windows support
**** look into getting some sort of certification to bypass SmartScreen
***** c.f. https://getimageview.net/2020/06/02/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-is-hurting-independent-developers/
**** ensure AVI support works fully
***** display thumbnails and play video
***** extract original date/time if available
**** ensure support for popular image formats (whatever is popular on Windows)
***** BMP (Windows Bitmap)

****** need a process to assemble the application deliverable
***** Supports Rust, Dart, Flutter
***** Supports macOS, Windows?, Linux?
***** Likely need a build machine for each target (mac, windows, linux)
***** Contenders
******* https://bazel.build
******* https://please.build
******* https://jenkins.io
******* https://www.buildbot.net
***** Bazel
****** supports all major platforms
****** a very sophisticated replacement for =make=
****** not appropriate for replacing =cargo= or =flutter build=
****** dart: https://github.com/cbracken/rules_dart
****** rust: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust
****** rust: https://github.com/google/cargo-raze
******* tries to replace cargo to get benefits of bazel
*** Branding: name, logo
*** Tracking issues and releases on a schedule (SCM)
**** Consider if using GitLab (in a container) would be helpful
** Documentation
*** Uploads directory
**** asset importer ignores hidden files and directories
*** Case Sensitivity
- Data is stored as entered (case preservative)
- Attribute lists are all lowercased
- Search is always case insensitive
*** Date/Time values
- Everything is treated as UTC
- EXIF data does not contain timezone information after all
- [[http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-43/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns][Date_Format_Patterns]]
** Architecture Review
*** Large file upload
**** split file into chunks, upload one-by-one, showing progress
***** default to 8MB chunks, most images will be smaller than that

*** Multi-user support
**** login page
***** desktop app could use keychain to get access
**** password reset (via email?)
**** access restrictions
**** private sets
**** comments
**** favorites
**** likes
**** rating levels (e.g. mature)
*** Display "N years ago" assets like Facebook does
*** Import directly from the camera
*** Custom metadata
*** Hierarchical categories: People -> Friends -> School
*** Hierarchical locations: USA -> California -> Los Angeles
*** Groups and subgroups of assets
