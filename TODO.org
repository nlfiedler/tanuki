*** TODO Translate caption parsing code
*** TODO Translate query parsing code
*** TODO implement HTTP endpoint to upload asset and return path

*** TODO how to upload files via graphql
**** via graphql: https://morioh.com/p/8120c733a77c
*** TODO use docker container to build web assets
*** ideas and widget usage
**** Look for the =video_player= web plugin for playing video in webui
**** use =RichText= widget to style the captions (e.g. make tags bold)
**** tags in caption could be "gesture sensitive" (i.e. clickable) to show assets with that tag
**** =ListView.builder= allows building list items on demand
***** c.f. https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-infinite-list-tutorial-with-flutter-bloc-2fc7a272ec67
**** =Image= has a loading builder for showing progress of network images
**** use =semanticLabel= on =Image= for accessibility
**** =Wrap= will do what =flex-flow: row wrap;= does in CSS
**** =FutureBuilder= for showing things that load asynchronously
**** use =SliverAppBar= in place of =AppBar=, it will shrink when content is scrolled
***** could be a good way to keep controls above scrolling content
**** use =FadeInImage= to show a placeholder while loading a remote image
**** maybe use =Hero= to animate/transition from image gallery to a single image
***** click on item in a list/grid and it expands to the details page
**** can use =DataTable= to display labeled data (like asset details, metadata)
**** use pointer enter/exit events to start playing a video in place
**** could check for thumbnails in image EXIF data
***** look for =JPEGThumbnail= or =TIFFThumbnail=
*** TODO remove ReasonML related code and Node modules
**** should be nothing JavaScript/Node/Reason left at this point

** Backend improvements
*** TODO Thumbnail size cache population is noticably slow when selecting many assets
** Search Improvements
*** TODO Support advanced queries using Google-style operators
**** c.f. https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en
**** move perkeep style query support from mujina to tanuki
**** webui needs an "advanced" tab/link selector on the search page
*** TODO Support searching the caption text
*** TODO Support wildcards in filename, mimetype (others?)
*** TODO Need a query to find image assets whose orientation is incorrect/unknown
** Data Format Support
*** TODO Detect time zone offset in EXIF data
According to Wikipedia the 2.31 version of EXIF will support time-zone
information. Eventually, the application should be able to detect this and
include it in the database records.

: There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus
: rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information have
: been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are:
: "OffsetTime", "OffsetTimeOriginal" and "OffsetTimeDigitized".

*** TODO Extract exact location information from images [0/4]
- [ ] Write a data migration to process existing assets
- [ ] Incoming needs to extract this information for new assets
- [ ] Existing location values should be stored in "label" field
- [ ] Exact location information should be stored separate from label
** Documentation
*** Case Sensitivity
- Data is stored as entered (case preservative)
- Attribute lists are all lowercased
- Search is always case insensitive
*** Date/Time values
- Uses 24 hour clock, displays using local time zone, stored as UTC
- [[http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-43/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns][Date_Format_Patterns]]
** Desktop app
*** Showing the licenses/about dialog
**** c.f. "licenses" on https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/faq
** Mobile app
*** Use [[https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker][image_picker]] to allow user to select images from photo library
** Design Notes
*** Dart vs Rust
| Dart YES            | Dart NO              | Rust YES              | Rust NO      |
|---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+--------------|
| productive language | no good database     | embedded database     | slow compile |
| good image library  | no secondary index   | secondary index       |              |

*** shelf vs angel
**** shelf
***** faster for both vm and native
***** generally more coding effort
***** lacks file upload (see shelf issue 119)
**** angel
***** has everything (static files, CORS, etc)
***** supports HTTP and GraphQL thoroughly
***** integration of graphql is very easy
** Legacy ReasonML, Node.js
*** N.B. bs-platform module version
**** cannot upgrade to 7.0.1 because ReasonApollo fails to compile
*** N.B. react-apollo module version
**** reason-apollo still depends on react-apollo 2.5.8
**** upgrading react-apollo to >3.x breaks reason-apollo
**** must wait until reason-apollo updates their dependencies
*** Front-end improvements
**** TODO Debounce the data validation fields using async validators
**** TODO Consider how to make thumbnail page responsive
***** Show 1, 2, 3, or more depending on browser width
***** Should be able to leverage CSS for this
**** TODO Asset preview page shows a broken link, should show placeholder image
**** TODO Add error boundary handling (requires React API changes)
***** waiting on support for =didCatch= in React Hooks API
***** also likely need the API exposed via ReasonReact
***** see the =ErrorBoundary= module definition in =Index.re=
**** TODO Use a lightbox component for displaying assets
***** c.f. https://creativebulma.net/product/lightbox/demo
*** Bugs
**** TODO Sometimes the front-end misses updates from backend?
***** e.g. click a tag, images fail to appear; click and click again, works
***** zorigami has this problem, too; seems like ReasonML is failing somehow
***** find out what is going on when this happens
**** TODO Home page fails to update after data changs
***** TODO Home page stays stuck on "upload" even after images are uploaded
****** name the =CountAssets= query and add to the =refetchQueries= list
***** TODO After editing asset, selections need to elide newly removed tags
****** that is, found "opa)", selected assets, fixed them, now cannot clear selection
****** need to attach an update function after the edit asset mutation completes
****** c.f. =onCompleted= prop on =mutation= function
******* https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/mutations/
****** can also set =awaitRefetchQueries= to wait for refetch to complete
****** could move Locations/Tags/Years logic into =Home= and handle everything there
****** could use GraphQL subscriptions in =Home= to keep track of changes
*** Development Support
**** TODO Figure out how to deal with the GraphQL schema weirdness
***** The introspection tool generates weird types for the non-optional array of strings
***** Maybe that tool is correct and my types are wrong?
***** Or maybe that tool has an update that fixes this?
***** c.f. commit =b8fa735=
** Old "rewrite backend in Dart" notes
*** DONE find a web framework
**** DONE read https://dart.dev/tutorials/server/httpserver
**** DONE read https://dart-lang.github.io/server/
***** all rather out of date
**** DONE ensure support for CORS requests
***** dart example in =httpserver= just injects the headers
***** see =note_server.dart= in https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/
**** DONE ensure support for static files
***** use =VirtualDirectory= from =http_server= package
***** see =static_file_server.dart= example of serving =index.html= by default
**** DONE catch-all route that sends everything else to the SPA
**** DONE evaluate https://pub.dev/packages/http_server
***** only API documentation, no examples or guides
***** probably meant to use shelf instead of this directly
***** theoretically can do everything, it's just all manual
**** DONE evaluate https://github.com/dart-lang/shelf
***** inspired by connect, rack, wsgi
***** similar to warp or plug, modular design for composable servers
***** offers logging middleware
****** look at how to integrate with https://pub.dev/packages/logging
***** easy request handling with "handlers"
***** easy composability with "pipelines"
***** static files: https://pub.dev/packages/shelf_static
***** routing: https://pub.dev/packages/shelf_router
**** DONE evaluate https://github.com/stablekernel/aqueduct
***** essentially a one developer project
***** featureful all-in-one framework
***** primarily focused on REST
***** supports automated testing
***** seems a bit big and far more than needed for tanuki
**** DONE evaluate https://pub.dev/packages/angel_framework
***** largely inspired by express.js
***** only one developer, at risk of abandonment
***** many add-on modules for various functionality
***** supports automated testing
***** scaffold generator is broken due to monorepo changes
***** considerably slower than shelf, and more so when native
**** DONE evaluate https://jaguar-dart.com
***** not updated since last July
**** DONE get a basic web server going with shelf
***** DONE serve some requests
***** DONE set up logging (console by default)
***** DONE take the port number from the environment (default 4000)
***** DONE take the host address from environment (default 'localhost')
***** DONE serve the static files
***** DONE serve a static GraphQL response
***** DONE add CORS headers using middleware
***** DONE check that =OPTIONS= method is handled
***** DONE check that correct mimetype is returned for static files
***** DONE map all missing results to =index.html= (i.e. no 404)
***** DONE =GET= on =/graphql= route throws errors now
**** DONE use some load testing tool to ensure core use
***** =ab= is already installed but dated and often freezes
***** =brew install hey= (the ab replacement, works better)
***** =hey -n 10000 http://localhost:<port>/=
****** ~-exe~ is the compiled executable

**** seems like they are not invoked (e.g. resolver for =filename= field of asset is not called)
**** API doc suggests that Maps are probed automatically, so resolver is called if it is an object?
*** TODO Get information from video files
**** Dart packages for ffmpeg have limited platform support
**** May be easier to write Dart code to extract the information from the file
***** this would avoid having additional static file dependencies
