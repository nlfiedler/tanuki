  - [TODO] https://github.com/lovell/sharp
  - [TODO] https://github.com/mattiasw/ExifReader
  - [TODO] https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg
  - [TODO] Use [catbox](https://github.com/hapijs/catbox) for thumbnail caching
- [TODO] Invoke `query()` with a `limit` of zero to populate the index after creating it

** General Items

- [TODO] migrate the old data over to the new document format
  - the sha256 value becomes the document _id
- [TODO] Need to read `apiUrlPrefix` in Elm code from configuration file
  - currently it is modified at deployment time using `sed`
- [TODO] Support HEIC/HEIF file formats
- [TODO] Add a "people" field
  - How to set this in import?
  - Need an admin screen to move a tag from "tags" to "people"
  - Maybe a generic "move" action:
    + Given a list of tags to be moved...
    + And the name of a field (e.g. "people")...
    + Move the given tags to the named field
- [TODO] Instead of a "topic" field, perhaps an "occasion" field instead.
  - For instance, "christina birthday".
  - Add back to incoming processor using the "^" separator.
  - Would be on details/edit page for benefit of uploading.
  - Maybe don't bother exposing on main page, just another field like caption.
- [TODO] api to perform database compaction
- [TODO] Decide what process manager to use; possibly launchd on macOS
  - http://expressjs.com/en/advanced/pm.html
- [TODO] Review express.js performance guidelines
  - http://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html

** Migration

- [TODO] Consider extracting more information from videos and images into database
  - Like the sorts of attributes that Photos uses to make smart albums

** Custom queries

- [TODO] Once a user has removed a custom query, invoke PouchDB's `db.viewCleanup()` to clean them up
