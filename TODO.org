* Tanuki
** TODO Replace =graphql_ppx= with =graphql_ppx_re=
*** c.f. https://github.com/baransu/graphql_ppx_re
** N.B. bs-platform module version
*** cannot upgrade to 6.2.1 because graphql_ppx is incompatible
*** cannot upgrade to 7.0.1 because ReasonApollo fails to compile
** N.B. react-apollo module version
*** reason-apollo still depends on react-apollo 2.5.8
*** upgrading react-apollo to >3.x breaks reason-apollo
*** must wait until reason-apollo updates their dependencies
** TODO Look at [[https://www.material.io][Material Design]] for icons and such
*** they provide free icons that are well thought out
** TODO Write an export function to dump database in JSON format
*** need this to import into the new database based on RocksDB
** TODO Rewrite backend in Rust
*** TODO Translate caption parsing code
*** TODO Translate query parsing code
*** TODO Translate database layer to use RocksDB and =mokuroku=
*** TODO Write data import/export function to save/load from JSON
*** Libraries
**** Facial recognition
***** https://crates.io/crates/opencv (WTFPL)
**** Videos
***** need Rust bindings for =ffprobe= and =ffmpeg=
****** https://crates.io/crates/ffmpeg-next
****** https://crates.io/crates/metadata
***** see if there are alternatives for Rust
**** Images
***** HEIF: https://github.com/oussama/libheif-rs
***** give this a try: https://github.com/imazen/imageflow
***** search crates.io for =vips= bindings, there are several
***** if all else fails, can use =magick-rust= (needs bindgen updates soon)
** Front-end improvements
*** TODO Debounce the data validation fields using async validators
*** TODO Consider how to make thumbnail page responsive
**** Show 1, 2, 3, or more depending on browser width
**** Should be able to leverage CSS for this
*** TODO Asset preview page shows a broken link, should show placeholder image
*** TODO Add error boundary handling (requires React API changes)
**** waiting on support for =didCatch= in React Hooks API
**** also likely need the API exposed via ReasonReact
**** see the =ErrorBoundary= module definition in =Index.re=
*** TODO Use a lightbox component for displaying assets
**** c.f. https://creativebulma.net/product/lightbox/demo
** Backend improvements
*** TODO Support advanced queries using Google-style operators
**** c.f. https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en
**** move perkeep style query support from mujina to tanuki
**** webui needs an "advanced" tab/link selector on the search page
*** TODO Thumbnail size cache population is noticably slow when selecting many assets
*** TODO consider using [[https://github.com/vertexclique/bastion][bastion]] for fault-tolerance (i.e. supervisor)
**** it appears to support Erlang-style supervisor behavior
** Bugs
*** TODO Sometimes the front-end misses updates from backend?
**** e.g. click a tag, images fail to appear; click and click again, works
**** find out what is going on when this happens
*** TODO Home page fails to update after data changs
**** TODO Home page stays stuck on "upload" even after images are uploaded
***** name the =CountAssets= query and add to the =refetchQueries= list
**** TODO After editing asset, selections need to elide newly removed tags
***** that is, found "opa)", selected assets, fixed them, now cannot clear selection
***** need to attach an update function after the edit asset mutation completes
***** c.f. =onCompleted= prop on =mutation= function
****** https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/mutations/
***** can also set =awaitRefetchQueries= to wait for refetch to complete
***** could move Locations/Tags/Years logic into =Home= and handle everything there
***** could use GraphQL subscriptions in =Home= to keep track of changes
** Development Support
*** TODO Figure out how to deal with the GraphQL schema weirdness
**** The introspection tool generates weird types for the non-optional array of strings
**** Maybe that tool is correct and my types are wrong?
**** Or maybe that tool has an update that fixes this?
**** c.f. commit =b8fa735=
** Search Improvements
*** TODO Support searching the caption text
*** TODO Support wildcards in filename, mimetype (others?)
*** TODO Need a query to find image assets whose orientation is incorrect/unknown
** Data Format Support
*** TODO Use an =iframe= to preview Markdown generated as HTML
*** TODO Detect time zone offset in EXIF data
According to Wikipedia the 2.31 version of EXIF will support time-zone
information. Eventually, the application should be able to detect this and
include it in the database records.

: There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus
: rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information have
: been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are:
: "OffsetTime", "OffsetTimeOriginal" and "OffsetTimeDigitized".

*** TODO Extract exact location information from images [0/4]
- [ ] Write a data migration to process existing assets
- [ ] Incoming needs to extract this information for new assets
- [ ] Existing location values should be stored in "label" field
- [ ] Exact location information should be stored separate from label

** Documentation
*** Case Sensitivity
- Data is stored as entered (case preservative)
- Attribute lists are all lowercased
- Search is always case insensitive

*** Date/Time values
- Uses 24 hour clock, displays using local time zone, stored as UTC
- [[http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-43/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns][Date_Format_Patterns]]
