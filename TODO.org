** Quick UI improvements
*** TODO how to stop the browser from navigating when form is not saved
**** should have this on the recents page because there can be many fields
**** enable once user enters any values, disable when save button is pressed
**** c.f. https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-webapi-incubator/issues/151
**** c.f. https://github.com/jacobbuck/react-beforeunload
** Video metadata support
*** https://github.com/alfg/mp4rs (MIT)
**** creation time is in =moov.mvhd.creation_time=
**** does not seem to support the videos produced by iOS
*** https://github.com/mozilla/mp4parse-rust (MPL-2.0)
**** intentionally skips the creation time fields
*** Fork the mp4rs code and add the missing functionality
**** mp4parse-rust seems to support more types of boxes
**** it intentionally skips over the creation time fields
*** Find the MPEG-4 specification on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14][wikipedia]] page
*** Could just try invoking =ffprobe= and if that works, use it
**** if it fails for any reason, ignore it
**** https://github.com/nomalab/stainless-ffmpeg
***** prerequisites
****** macos: =brew install ffmpeg=
** Large File Import
*** naturally this is for videos, so proper video support is required
*** TODO on upload screen, provide input field to accessible file path
*** TODO create a record, move file into place

** Performance
*** measure and improve the thumbnail serving
**** consider caching in memory or on disk
***** unbound caching on disk will consume space forever
***** should have an on-disk LRU cache with a set capacity
**** test images for measurements

*** consider if caching search results will improve responsiveness
**** could return a query code to the caller in search meta
**** caller returns that code in the next query to access the cache
**** in this way, the results for a particular query can be cached reliably
**** eventually cached search results need to be pruned
**** RocksDB by default has a block cache of 8mb in 16 shards of 512kb
**** also consider that any caching should live in the data source
*** consider if filtering can be done "in the database" somehow
**** database queries should probably take a filter closure
**** database functions iterate the results, applying the filter
**** the remaining results are then collecting into a vector
** Shared Folder Cleanup
*** write a script to checksum files and check if they are in tanuki
*** anything found in tanuki is deleted
** Frontend Rewrite
*** Use Dart and Flutter
*** Use Clean Architecture
**** define the features
***** browse
***** search
***** import
***** export
***** edit
*** Thumbnail Serving Strategy
**** capture the image/video dimensions during import, save to asset record
***** a larger asset record in CBOR format is ~260 bytes, a few more bytes is okay
***** in PouchDB, each record takes almost exactly 1 kilobyte
***** use =u32= for each dimension (should be more than enough)
**** on import, ensure asset identifier ends with correct media type extension
***** if provided filename does not end in the correct extension, append it
****** use the provided media type to know what extension to add
***** this ensures correct guessing of media type when making thumbnails
***** n.b. all thumbnails and previews are image/jpeg anyway so this is not necessary
***** if, someday, the provided media type is "unknown", then use mime sniffer
***** c.f. https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org
***** c.f. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/How_Mozilla_determines_MIME_Types
***** c.f. https://github.com/flier/rust-mime-sniffer
**** the frontend can use the image dimensions to compute the aspect ratio
**** with the aspect ratio, frontend can request images of the desired size
**** frontend can ask for images that are N pixels high or M pixels wide, or whatever
***** by leaving one dimension maxed out, the image aspect ratio will be maintained
**** as long as client keeps asking for the same basic size, backend can cache them
**** when generating thumbnail, always use jpeg format so content type is =image/jpeg=
*** TODO find out how to upload a file
**** https://rodolfohernan20.blogspot.com/2019/12/upload-files-to-server-with-flutter-web.html
**** example code: https://github.com/rjcalifornia/web_upload
*** TODO how to handle file drops
**** drop zone gist: https://gist.github.com/PlugFox/ffe83a91ce50f9c78a5b1d6674e36d1b
**** for now this is not so important, just use file selector a la =web_upload= example
*** TODO use docker container to build web assets
*** Thoughts on the design
**** browse and search
***** unify the two pages into one
***** with the "crane" like selectors, the search is just another row of inputs
***** that is, normally the second row is collapsed, but clicking a button expands it
***** the second row would have the date range, file name, and media type
**** quick import
***** drag/drop and/or file open to add lots of assets
***** immediately import everything to the backend
***** show progress and display thumbnails as assets are successfully imported
***** switch to the "recent imports" screen showing just these new assets
***** user selects multiple assets and applies tags and locations to them
***** click on an asset to enter a caption in place (without leaving the gallery view)
**** image gallery selectors
***** instead of showing all of the tags, years, locations at once
****** see the "crane" flutter gallery sample for the basic layout and appearance
****** use input fields with small icons on the left and drop-down button on the right
****** typing into the field will perform completion for tags, locations, years
****** clicking on the drop-down will offer selection of attributes
****** once entered or selected, input fields show active selectors
****** maybe have a small x to deactive active selectors
****** can also remove selectors by backspacing
**** image gallery display
***** show selects for months of the year to jump to that time range
****** eventually this selector needs to consider the sort field and order
***** show additional details on mouse hover
***** button in corner of thumbnail to select assets to edit, download, etc
***** option to switch to "list" view with smaller thumbnail and labels aligned in rows
**** asset detail page
***** seems popular to show the gallery items as small thumbnails along the top (horizontally scrollable)
***** have chevron buttons on both sides to navigate through gallery items (e.g. "lightbox")
**** timeline style display for all assets
***** without any selectors, just show most recent going back in time
*** ideas and widget usage
**** Look at the Flutter "Gallery" app ("crane") for a pretty example
***** gently rounded image corners
***** gallery background has rounded corners
***** pleasing captions
***** interesting not-quite-grid (column oriented) arrangement
***** selectors across the top
***** floating ~Back~ button at the bottom left
**** Consider how to have a "light" and "dark" mode
**** Look for the =video_player= web plugin for playing video in webui
**** use =RichText= widget to style the captions (e.g. make tags bold)
**** tags in caption could be "gesture sensitive" (i.e. clickable) to show assets with that tag
**** =ListView.builder= allows building list items on demand
***** c.f. https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-infinite-list-tutorial-with-flutter-bloc-2fc7a272ec67
**** =Image= has a loading builder for showing progress of network images
**** use =semanticLabel= on =Image= for accessibility
**** =Wrap= will do what =flex-flow: row wrap;= does in CSS
**** alternative to row wrapping would be columns of images
***** need to make the number of columns responsive to window width
**** =FutureBuilder= for showing things that load asynchronously
**** use =SliverAppBar= in place of =AppBar=, it will shrink when content is scrolled
***** could be a good way to keep controls above scrolling content
**** use =FadeInImage= to show a placeholder while loading a remote image
**** maybe use =Hero= to animate/transition from image gallery to a single image
***** click on item in a list/grid and it expands to the details page
**** can use =DataTable= to display labeled data (like asset details, metadata)
**** use pointer enter/exit events to start playing a video in place
*** TODO remove ReasonML and Node files
**** should be nothing JavaScript/Node/Reason left at this point
**** =bsconfig.json=
**** =graphql_schema.json=
**** =gulpfile.js=
**** =node_modules=
**** =package.json=
**** =package-lock.json=
**** =public=
**** =src/*.re=
**** =lib/js=
**** =lib/bs=
**** update =.gitignore= and =.dockerignore=
** Search Improvements
*** TODO Support advanced queries using Google-style operators
**** c.f. https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en
**** move perkeep style query support from mujina to tanuki
**** webui needs an "advanced" tab/link selector on the search page
**** =is:image= and similar to filter by media type
**** =with:<name>= to filter by people (need to know the people though)
**** =AND= and =OR= operators and grouping with parentheses
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no tags at all
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no location at all
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no caption at all
*** TODO Support searching the caption text
**** likely would involve a full table scan
*** TODO Support wildcards in filename, mimetype (others?)
**** likely would involve a full table scan
*** TODO searching for images by dimensions (~pano~, ~landscape~, ~portrait~)
*** TODO searching assets by metadata values (=meta:exif:field=value=)
** Easy export
*** want this for the christmas calendar
*** easy selection and export of images
**** Selection process
***** Maybe show selection icon thingy on hover, click to select
***** Maybe shift-click to select by thumbnails
**** Export process
***** Maybe main menu has "export" feature to export selected assets
***** Maybe action panel appears when there are selections
***** Show "file save" dialog to choose local file path
***** Save assets using their unique filename
** Data Format Support
*** Auto-populate missing fields on load
**** when loading an asset, detect missing data (e.g. no original time)
**** try reading the data from the asset and save to the asset record
**** in the future, as more data formats are supported, can fill in the blanks
*** Read other metadata formats
**** XMP
**** IPTC
*** TODO support HEIF images
**** https://crates.io/crates/libvips (MIT) reads/writes HEIF
***** this library easily crashes with a segmentation fault
**** https://github.com/oussama/libheif-rs (MIT)
**** https://crates.io/crates/kamadak-exif (BSD) reads metadata
*** Support audio formats
**** get audio playback working
**** read =ID3= tags in audio files
*** TODO Detect time zone offset in EXIF data
According to Wikipedia the 2.31 version of EXIF will support time-zone
information. Eventually, the application should be able to detect this and
include it in the database records.

: There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus
: rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information have
: been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are:
: "OffsetTime", "OffsetTimeOriginal" and "OffsetTimeDigitized".

*** TODO Extract location information from images
**** write a data migration to process existing assets
**** existing location values should be stored in a "label" field
**** exact location information would be stored separate from label
**** c.f. https://github.com/google/open-location-code/wiki/Evaluation-of-Location-Encoding-Systems
**** c.f. https://www.osgeo.org for some information, resources
*** TODO Display thumbnails for PDF files
*** TODO Read metadata from PDF files
**** probably has a creation date or some sort
*** TODO Show the =AAE= files as plain text (they are xml)
*** TODO Detect if an image is a "portrait" using metadata
*** TODO Support display of TIFF, EXIF, JFIF data for images
*** TODO Display the image resolution in the asset sidebar
*** TODO Render Markdown as HTML in a scrollable view
*** TODO Display anything textual in a scrollable text area
*** Reference
**** EXIF: https://www.media.mit.edu/pia/Research/deepview/exif.html
** Bulk edit
*** Short term solution akin to perkeep web interface
**** hover over thumbnail, shows checkbox button in the corner
**** click on the checkbox to select the asset
**** once selected, the actions panel slides in from the side
**** image gallery shrinks to fit the actions panel
- [ ] Easy selection with hover checkbox button
  - Could use =svg= tag to render the button
  - See pexels.com in that it uses article tag, with nested img and button with nested svg
- [ ] When selections, filters panel changes to show available actions
- [ ] Actions include adding, deleting tags, setting location
  - This is basically a simplified bulk edit
- [ ] Use a prefix for the checksum values
*** Design bulk edit solution, probably similar to JIRA
- [ ] Access the bulk edit screen via a menu item
- [ ] Use search form
- [ ] Perform search, present results using "list" view
- [ ] Check off results as desired
- [ ] Next page presents several operations
  - [ ] add location
  - [ ] remove location
  - [ ] rename location
  - [ ] add a tag
  - [ ] remove a tag
  - [ ] rename a tag
  - [ ] set caption
  - [ ] change media type
** Documentation
*** Case Sensitivity
- Data is stored as entered (case preservative)
- Attribute lists are all lowercased
- Search is always case insensitive
*** Date/Time values
- Everything is treated as UTC
- EXIF data does not contain timezone information after all
- [[http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-43/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns][Date_Format_Patterns]]
** Data Migrations
*** start planning on how to handle data(base) migrations
*** may be a good idea to introduce "metadata" records for assets
**** use a =metadata/= prefix with the id of the asset
**** can hold all sorts of additional information without cluttering the asset
**** should be some form of dictionary to keep things flexible
*** maintain an uber record for tracking database version
*** also the serde library is quite flexible with adding/removing fields
** Architecture Review
*** Concurrent modifications
**** Consider how to manage multiple users making changes
**** e.g. two people trying to update the same set of recent imports
**** e.g. two people trying to edit the same asset
**** this is known as the ~lost update~ problem
**** usually managed with a revision number on the record
***** updates must include the revision number; if mismatch, raise error
***** HTTP uses the =ETag= value and the =If-Match= header for this purpose
**** maybe keep an edit history or revision number in separate records
*** GraphQL server
**** consider https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql as alternative to juniper
***** handles multipart requests (file uploads)
***** provides actix-web integration
** Desktop app
*** Need setup for configuration system
**** properties
***** path for database files
***** path for where file uploads go temporarily
***** path for where assets are stored
**** default configuration setup at build-time
***** would be nice to have something like Dart's =environment_config=
****** could use =build.rs= to generate an environment config
******* then load that in =main.rs= to get everything into memory
***** https://github.com/andoriyu/uclicious (BSD)
***** https://github.com/mehcode/config-rs (MIT)
**** screen for configuring the settings
*** Showing the licenses/about dialog
**** c.f. "licenses" on https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/faq
** Mobile web support
*** Progressive Web App support in Flutter is coming as of 2020/04
*** Use PWA to get app-like behavior on mobile devices
*** Look for package (like image_picker) that enables user to select photos to upload
** Mobile app
*** Use [[https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker][image_picker]] to allow user to select images from photo library
*** Upload while away from home
**** mobile app with upload to a "drop box", backend then retrieves those (on a schedule?)
**** evaluate [[https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole][magic-wormhole]] as a means of transferring directly to the home computer
** Build Automation
*** For building the applications
*** Requirements
**** Consistent builds
**** Need this for building the application, not compiling code
***** dart, flutter, and rust/cargo all know how to compile code
***** need a process to assemble the application deliverable
**** Supports Rust, Dart, Flutter
**** Supports macOS, Windows?, Linux?
**** Likely need a build machine for each target (mac, windows, linux)
**** Contenders
****** https://bazel.build
****** https://please.build
****** https://jenkins.io
****** https://www.buildbot.net
**** Bazel
***** supports all major platforms
***** a very sophisticated replacement for =make=
***** not appropriate for replacing =cargo= or =flutter build=
***** dart: https://github.com/cbracken/rules_dart
***** rust: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust
***** rust: https://github.com/google/cargo-raze
****** tries to replace cargo to get benefits of bazel
** SCM
*** Consider if using GitLab (in a container) would be helpful
** Features
*** Slide show mode for assets matching search
**** look for NCS BGM to play during the slide show
*** ML to identify objects, people, etc in photos
**** ML recognizes the subject (dog, cat, person, etc)
**** opencv for face recognition
***** consider licensing commercial library for this
*** ML to rank photos on various qualities
**** c.f. https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/
**** ML assigns scores on aesthetics, interest, etc
*** Easy publishing to sharing sites (e.g. Google Photos)
**** option to resize image
**** option to change format
**** option to strip metadata
**** option to apply watermarks
**** option to save in ePub format for iOS
**** button to open asset in file browser
*** Easy import from external sites (e.g. google, instagram)
*** Large file import
**** Split file into chunks, upload one-by-one, showing progress
**** Default to 8MB chunks, most images will be smaller than that
*** Editing Images
**** Keep track of the asset revisions
**** Allow user to select the primary version (e.g. undo)
**** rotate, flip, flop, crop
**** apply common filters
***** c.f. https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon
**** open asset in external program in temporary file
*** Multi-user support
**** login page
***** desktop app could use keychain to get access
**** password reset (via email?)
**** access restrictions
**** private sets
**** comments
**** favorites
**** likes
**** rating levels (e.g. mature)
*** Albums
**** i.e. organize assets by project, subject, event
**** Apple Photos has ~smart~ albums
***** assets taken around the same time, place
**** save search results as a new album
*** Multiple libraries (like Apple Photos)
*** Map display with locations of photos taken
**** [[https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/][Google Maps]]
- customer uses their own API key, sets in preferences
- for =testing= account: =AIzaSyAI73udKC3KVk6aIBqOjSqSv6PEQ0qd638=
**** [[https://mariusandra.github.io/pigeon-maps/][Pigeon Maps]]
- Uses data from OpenStreetMap, Wikimedia for the tiles
*** Display "N years ago" assets like Facebook does
*** Import directly from the camera
*** random ideas
**** Custom metadata
**** Hierarchical categories: People -> Friends -> School
**** Hierarchical locations: USA -> California -> Los Angeles
**** Groups and subgroups of assets
***** Turkey > Gallipoli Peninsula > Gali Winery
***** Winery > vinification > fermentation tanks
***** Architecture > Buildings > underground cellar
**** Converting videos to animated GIFs
**** Extracting a frame from a video
**** Creating a calendar
**** OCR of images, PDFs
**** Task automation
***** e.g. editing image metadata
***** e.g. resize, rotate, format conversion
***** e.g. watermarks
***** e.g. strip location data
*****  store changes in "alternates"
**** Scripting support
**** portable mode for thumb-drive based usage
**** demo bundle that includes some preloaded assets
** Data Integrity
*** Expose data integrity checks in frontend
**** consider if using GraphQL subscriptions would make sense
***** would return each asset id and success bool or list of error codes
***** results would be returned one at a time for the frontend to show progress
***** the error codes would be encoded as GraphQL enums
**** add an option to purge bad records
***** errors of type base64, utf8, missing are not recoverable
**** find files for which there are no documents
*** should have automated backups of the database
**** every M operations or T minutes/hours/days
*** add controls for dumping and loading the database
**** provides another mechanism for backup
**** power users could perform large bulk edits of data
** First Hour
*** Initial help screen when there is zero content
*** Describe elements of the home page (e.g. interactive tutorial)
*** Open a web page with helpful first steps
* Technical Items
** Product Assembly
*** Create new (private) repo that includes =tanuki= and =mujina= as submodules
*** Build the components and assemble into the final package
*** Branding elements will live here, probabaly
** Automated Testing
*** TODO Look into automated testing frameworks for Electron apps
- See http://airbnb.io/enzyme/ for writing React tests
- Read https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/testing
- https://github.com/facebook/jest
  - uses =expect= library
  - handles React apps
- https://github.com/electron/spectron
  - Test Electron apps using ChromeDriver
- https://github.com/electron/devtron
  - Official DevTools extension

** Windows support
*** Development and Testing
- Can use Microsoft Azure to create a Windows VM for testing
- VMs free to use for 90 days https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/

*** Menus
- Use "Settings" instead of "Preferences" on windows
- The "Settings" menu item should use an appropriate shortcut

*** Issues specific to Windows
**** TODO The =NODE_ENV=test= in =package.json= does not work on Windows
Does not work in Git Bash either

**** TODO =npm test= fails because of relative import paths
Other code has identical paths, why only the tests don't work?

**** TODO About menu item seemingly does nothing
* Non-technical Items
** Productization
*** Application name
