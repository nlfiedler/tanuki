* Tanuki
** Backend Rewrite
*** Clean Architecture design
**** use dependency injection to connect parts together
***** https://crates.io/crates/shaku (compile-time IoC)
***** https://crates.io/crates/coi (compile-time IoC)
***** consider if writing one from scratch (a la =get_it=) would be adequate
**** use TDD and mocking to develop from the inside out
***** https://crates.io/crates/mockall
**** entities
***** asset
***** location (label, gps, etc)
***** search result (location, media type, filename, date)
**** use cases
***** count all assets
***** import asset
***** update asset details
***** get all locations
***** get all years
***** get all tags
***** search for assets
***** get asset by checksum
***** fetch asset details
***** backup the database (an automatic function?)
****** use repository to invoke backup/restore functions
****** data source for record database invokes the db functions
**** repositories
***** record database
***** blob store
*** TODO implement HTTP endpoint to upload asset and return path
**** the GraphQL upload feature is non-standard, not implemented by juniper
**** path would be for a temporary file that gets removed after some time
**** client returns path in a GraphQL mutation to "upload" the asset
**** need to maintain the original name of the uploaded file for media type detection
**** consider how to write tests for this feature
*** TODO implement GraphQL backend
**** c.f. =public/schema.graphql=
**** n.b. =SearchResult= should have media type but it was missing before
**** n.b. =Asset= has a filepath, which should be retrieved from the repository
***** that is, =BlobRepository= should get a function named =relative_path()= that decodes the asset id
**** can represent optional user_date in asset update using an Option of Option
***** if Some(None) then clear the user date
***** if None then do not change the user date
***** if Some(Some(d)) then set the user date
**** should always paginate search results
**** queries
***** TODO asset(id: ID!): Asset
***** TODO lookup(checksum: String!): Asset
***** TODO count: Int!
***** TODO search(params: SearchParams!, count: Int = 10, offset: Int = 0): SearchMeta!
***** TODO locations: [LocationCount!]!
***** TODO tags: [TagCount!]!
***** TODO years: [YearCount!]!
**** mutations
***** TODO upload(file: Upload!): ID!
***** TODO update(id: ID!, asset: AssetInput!): Asset!
****** filter empty tags before sending to the usecase
*** TODO decide how to efficiently provide content type with raw assets
**** response includes content type (i.e. media type)
**** should minimize disk seeks and database reads
**** could decode asset id and guess media type from extension
**** could read media type from asset record and cache in memory
*** TODO decide how to efficiently provide thumbnail dimensions in search results
**** only need this for the progressive image gallery feature on client
**** client performs search via GraphQL, gets filename, location, datetime, mimetype
**** computing the dimensions takes time for each image, so data should be cached
**** secondary index cannot reasonably collect the dimensions from the asset model
**** should populate the cache when importing assets rather than when querying
**** GraphQL resolver merges dimension values with search results
**** blob repository provides dimensions
***** input is the asset identifier
***** data stored in separate database instance without mokuroku
****** rename =database.rs= to =indexdb.rs=
****** use =database.rs= from zorigami for a simpler database
***** repository can cache values in memory if needed
*** TODO serve the existing ReasonML frontend
**** add endpoints to get the thumbnails, previews, and assets
**** blob repository will produce the thumbnails
**** blob repository may cache results on disk and/or in memory
**** convert file upload to the 2-step process
*** TODO plan how database migrations will happen in the future
**** maintain a meta record with version information
**** look at how the serde.rs library can help
*** TODO extract metadata from incoming video assets
**** get the duration of videos in seconds
**** get the creation time of videos
**** need Rust bindings for =ffprobe= and =ffmpeg=
***** https://crates.io/crates/ffmpeg4 (WTFPL)
***** https://crates.io/crates/ffmpeg-dev (MIT/LGPL)
***** https://crates.io/crates/ffmpeg-next (WTFPL)
**** consider parsing the metadata to get the information
*** TODO video thumbnails
**** there are already some videos that have thumbnails
**** they have =.jpg= extension instead of the original (=.mov=)
**** should these be retained, removed, or rebuilt?
**** should these be generated on import, or as needed?
*** TODO need configuration mechanism
**** path for database files
**** path for where file uploads go temporarily
**** path for where assets are stored
**** would be nice to have something like Dart's =environment_config=
***** could use =build.rs= to generate an environment config
***** then load that in =main.rs= to get everything into memory
**** https://github.com/andoriyu/uclicious (BSD)
**** https://github.com/mehcode/config-rs (MIT)
*** TODO ensure there is no longer any =dead_code= or remove the pragma
*** TODO set up logging similar to zorigami
**** should be effectively disabled for testing (i.e. off by default)
*** TODO set up docker build for rust code and healthcheck
**** c.f. https://github.com/mastertinner/healthcheck
***** it has been updated since the copy in zorigami
**** look at https://github.com/bencord0/docker-healthcheck/
*** TODO write an export script for the old database
**** stand-alone script that reads the database and writes out json
*** TODO write an import binary for the new database
**** stand-alone binary that reads json and populates new database
**** maybe handle the (wide) thumbnail size caching at this point
*** TODO test database migration on development system
*** TODO perform migration on production system
**** stop and remove the current docker container
**** use script to get dump of current database
**** backup the database files somewhere safe
**** run the new binary to populate new database from data dump
**** deploy new docker container with new backend
*** TODO remove JavaScript code from =src= and =test=
*** TODO remove Node modules related to backend
*** TODO remove the incomplete =server= Dart code
*** TODO remove remaining old backend files
**** =public/schema.graphql=
**** =views/=
*** TODO document the clean architecture of this code base
** Adjust mujina file upload
*** Cannot use the apollo-client upload feature
*** Must upload the asset to the HTTP endpoint and then submit GraphQL mutation
** Frontend Rewrite
*** Use Dart and Flutter
*** Use Clean Architecture
**** define the features
***** browse
***** search
***** import
***** export
***** edit
*** TODO Move the files under =client/= to the root
*** TODO find out how to upload a file
**** https://rodolfohernan20.blogspot.com/2019/12/upload-files-to-server-with-flutter-web.html
**** example code: https://github.com/rjcalifornia/web_upload
*** TODO how to handle file drops
**** drop zone gist: https://gist.github.com/PlugFox/ffe83a91ce50f9c78a5b1d6674e36d1b
**** for now this is not so important, just use file selector a la =web_upload= example
*** TODO how to upload files via graphql
**** via graphql: https://morioh.com/p/8120c733a77c
*** TODO use docker container to build web assets
*** ideas and widget usage
**** Look for the =video_player= web plugin for playing video in webui
**** use =RichText= widget to style the captions (e.g. make tags bold)
**** tags in caption could be "gesture sensitive" (i.e. clickable) to show assets with that tag
**** =ListView.builder= allows building list items on demand
***** c.f. https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-infinite-list-tutorial-with-flutter-bloc-2fc7a272ec67
**** =Image= has a loading builder for showing progress of network images
**** use =semanticLabel= on =Image= for accessibility
**** =Wrap= will do what =flex-flow: row wrap;= does in CSS
**** =FutureBuilder= for showing things that load asynchronously
**** use =SliverAppBar= in place of =AppBar=, it will shrink when content is scrolled
***** could be a good way to keep controls above scrolling content
**** use =FadeInImage= to show a placeholder while loading a remote image
**** maybe use =Hero= to animate/transition from image gallery to a single image
***** click on item in a list/grid and it expands to the details page
**** can use =DataTable= to display labeled data (like asset details, metadata)
**** use pointer enter/exit events to start playing a video in place
**** could check for thumbnails in image EXIF data
***** look for =JPEGThumbnail= or =TIFFThumbnail=
*** TODO remove ReasonML related code and Node modules
**** should be nothing JavaScript/Node/Reason left at this point
**** =bsconfig.json=
**** =graphql_schema.json=
**** =gulpfile.js=
**** =node_modules=
**** =package.json=
**** =package-lock.json=
**** =public=
**** =src/*.re=
**** =lib/js=
**** =lib/bs=
**** update =.gitignore= and =.dockerignore=
*** TODO incorporate relevant items from mujina TODO file
** Performance
*** use =hey= to measure image serving performance
**** =brew install hey= (the =ab= replacement)
**** =hey -n 10000 http://localhost:<port>/=
***** numbers below are for serving =index.html=
***** ~-exe~ is the compiled executable
| service            |   qps |
|--------------------+-------|
| apache             | 15000 |
| zorigami           |  9400 |
| tanuki (node)      |  3000 |
| tanuki (shelf-exe) |  2600 |
| tanuki (angel-exe) |  1010 |
*** consider if caching/guessing mimetype is needed when serving images
*** consider a "sidecar" file with each asset that has this information
*** the repository and data source would have API for reading this data
** Search Improvements
*** TODO Support advanced queries using Google-style operators
**** c.f. https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en
**** move perkeep style query support from mujina to tanuki
**** webui needs an "advanced" tab/link selector on the search page
*** TODO Avoid loading all results into memory and then filtering
**** database queries should probably take a filter closure
**** database functions iterate the results, applying the filter
**** the remaining results are then collecting into a vector
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no tags at all
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no location at all
*** TODO Support searching for assets that have no caption at all
*** TODO Support searching the caption text
**** likely would involve a full table scan
*** TODO Support wildcards in filename, mimetype (others?)
**** likely would involve a full table scan
*** TODO Query for image assets whose orientation is incorrect/unknown
** Data Format Support
*** EXIF information
**** https://www.media.mit.edu/pia/Research/deepview/exif.html
*** TODO blob import always saves auto-oriented images as JPEG
**** should detect the format and use one of the other libvips save functions
*** TODO support HEIF images
**** https://crates.io/crates/libvips (MIT) reads/writes HEIF
**** https://github.com/oussama/libheif-rs (MIT)
**** https://crates.io/crates/kamadak-exif (BSD) reads metadata
*** TODO Detect time zone offset in EXIF data
According to Wikipedia the 2.31 version of EXIF will support time-zone
information. Eventually, the application should be able to detect this and
include it in the database records.

: There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus
: rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information have
: been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are:
: "OffsetTime", "OffsetTimeOriginal" and "OffsetTimeDigitized".

*** TODO Extract location information from images
**** write a data migration to process existing assets
**** existing location values should be stored in a "label" field
**** exact location information would be stored separate from label
*** TODO Read metadata from PDF files
**** probably has a creation date or some sort
** Documentation
*** Case Sensitivity
- Data is stored as entered (case preservative)
- Attribute lists are all lowercased
- Search is always case insensitive
*** Date/Time values
- Uses 24 hour clock, displays using local time zone, stored as UTC
- [[http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-43/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns][Date_Format_Patterns]]
** Desktop app
*** Showing the licenses/about dialog
**** c.f. "licenses" on https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/faq
** Mobile app
*** Use [[https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker][image_picker]] to allow user to select images from photo library
** Build Automation
*** For building the applications
*** Requirements
**** Consistent builds
**** Supports Rust, Dart, Flutter
**** Supports macOS, Windows?, Linux?
**** Likely need a build machine for each target (mac, windows, linux)
**** Contenders
****** https://bazel.build
****** https://please.build
****** https://jenkins.io
****** https://www.buildbot.net
** Extra Features
*** Image orientation
**** maybe not everyone is going to like that the images get auto-oriented on imports
**** could optionally leave the image alone and auto-orient when serving
**** c.f. https://www.daveperrett.com/articles/2012/07/28/exif-orientation-handling-is-a-ghetto/
** Design Notes
*** Dart vs Rust
| Dart YES            | Dart NO              | Rust YES              | Rust NO      |
|---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+--------------|
| productive language | no good database     | embedded database     | slow compile |
| good image library  | no secondary index   | secondary index       |              |
|                     | buggy GraphQL server | proven GraphQL server |              |
|                     | very slow web server | very fast web server  |              |
*** shelf vs angel
**** shelf
***** faster for both vm and native
***** generally more coding effort
***** lacks file upload (see shelf issue 119)
**** angel
***** has everything (static files, CORS, etc)
***** supports HTTP and GraphQL thoroughly
***** integration of graphql is very easy
** Legacy ReasonML, Node.js
*** N.B. bs-platform module version
**** cannot upgrade to 7.0.1 because ReasonApollo fails to compile
*** N.B. react-apollo module version
**** reason-apollo still depends on react-apollo 2.5.8
**** upgrading react-apollo to >3.x breaks reason-apollo
**** must wait until reason-apollo updates their dependencies
*** Front-end improvements
**** TODO Debounce the data validation fields using async validators
**** TODO Consider how to make thumbnail page responsive
***** Show 1, 2, 3, or more depending on browser width
***** Should be able to leverage CSS for this
**** TODO Asset preview page shows a broken link, should show placeholder image
**** TODO Add error boundary handling (requires React API changes)
***** waiting on support for =didCatch= in React Hooks API
***** also likely need the API exposed via ReasonReact
***** see the =ErrorBoundary= module definition in =Index.re=
**** TODO Use a lightbox component for displaying assets
***** c.f. https://creativebulma.net/product/lightbox/demo
*** Bugs
**** TODO Sometimes the front-end misses updates from backend?
***** e.g. click a tag, images fail to appear; click and click again, works
***** zorigami has this problem, too; seems like ReasonML is failing somehow
***** find out what is going on when this happens
**** TODO Home page fails to update after data changs
***** TODO Home page stays stuck on "upload" even after images are uploaded
****** name the =CountAssets= query and add to the =refetchQueries= list
***** TODO After editing asset, selections need to elide newly removed tags
****** that is, found "opa)", selected assets, fixed them, now cannot clear selection
****** need to attach an update function after the edit asset mutation completes
****** c.f. =onCompleted= prop on =mutation= function
******* https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/mutations/
****** can also set =awaitRefetchQueries= to wait for refetch to complete
****** could move Locations/Tags/Years logic into =Home= and handle everything there
****** could use GraphQL subscriptions in =Home= to keep track of changes
*** Development Support
**** TODO Figure out how to deal with the GraphQL schema weirdness
***** The introspection tool generates weird types for the non-optional array of strings
***** Maybe that tool is correct and my types are wrong?
***** Or maybe that tool has an update that fixes this?
***** c.f. commit =b8fa735=

*** DONE find a web framework
**** DONE read https://dart.dev/tutorials/server/httpserver
**** DONE read https://dart-lang.github.io/server/

**** DONE catch-all route that sends everything else to the SPA
**** DONE evaluate https://pub.dev/packages/http_server
***** only API documentation, no examples or guides
***** probably meant to use shelf instead of this directly
***** theoretically can do everything, it's just all manual
**** DONE evaluate https://github.com/dart-lang/shelf
***** inspired by connect, rack, wsgi
***** similar to warp or plug, modular design for composable servers
***** offers logging middleware

***** easy request handling with "handlers"
***** easy composability with "pipelines"
***** static files: https://pub.dev/packages/shelf_static
***** routing: https://pub.dev/packages/shelf_router
**** DONE evaluate https://github.com/stablekernel/aqueduct
***** essentially a one developer project
***** featureful all-in-one framework
***** primarily focused on REST
***** supports automated testing
***** seems a bit big and far more than needed for tanuki
**** DONE evaluate https://pub.dev/packages/angel_framework
***** largely inspired by express.js
***** only one developer, at risk of abandonment
***** many add-on modules for various functionality
***** supports automated testing
***** scaffold generator is broken due to monorepo changes
***** considerably slower than shelf, and more so when native
**** DONE evaluate https://jaguar-dart.com
***** not updated since last July
**** DONE get a basic web server going with shelf
***** DONE serve some requests
***** DONE set up logging (console by default)
***** DONE take the port number from the environment (default 4000)

***** DONE add CORS headers using middleware
***** DONE check that =OPTIONS= method is handled
***** DONE check that correct mimetype is returned for static files
***** DONE map all missing results to =index.html= (i.e. no 404)
***** DONE =GET= on =/graphql= route throws errors now
**** DONE use some load testing tool to ensure core use
***** =ab= is already installed but dated and often freezes
***** =brew install hey= (the ab replacement, works better)
***** =hey -n 10000 http://localhost:<port>/=
****** ~-exe~ is the compiled executable
