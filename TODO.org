** Help
*** write help pages for each of the main pages
**** location string parsing
- format is ~label~ ; ~city~ , ~region~
- semicolon separates label from city and region
- comma separates city from region
- without separators, value is treated as ~label~ only
- example label only: garden
- example label only: London
- example label only: England
- example label + city: garden; London
- example label + city + region: garden; London, England
- example city + region: London, England
- too many semicolons or commas result in a label-only value
**** advanced query support
***** operations can be grouped with parentheses
***** supported operations of the form =predicate:value=
****** some predicate support multiple arguments separated by colon
****** possible to have an empty argument (trailing only for now), as in =loc:label:=
| name     | example               | description                    |
|----------+-----------------------+--------------------------------|
| is       | is:image              | match on the media ~type~      |
| filename | filename:img_1234.jpg | match on exact filename        |
| format   | format:jpeg           | match on the media ~subtype~   |
| tag      | tag:cats              | match on a tag                 |
| loc      | loc:paris             | match on any location field    |
| loc      | loc:any:nice          | match on any location field    |

| loc      | loc:region:france     | match on location region field |
| before   | before:2017-05-13     | match before a given date      |
| after    | after:2017-05-13      | match after a given date       |
| -        | -format:jpeg          | inverse of next operation      |
| or       | tag:cat or tag:dog    | boolean or operator            |
| and      | tag:cat and tag:dog   | boolean and operator           |
***** predicate values can be enclosed in single or double quotes
***** character escapes within quoted strings will be evaluated
***** dates are RFC 3339 formatted (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)
***** dates can be year (~2010~), year and month (~2010-05~), or full (~2010-05-13~)
**** pending page
- query always looks for assets without tags, caption, and location label (all 3 are missing)
**** details page
- replacing the asset with the exact same file content will have no effect, even if a different file name
- replacing an asset will change the asset identifier, media type, file name, etc
- n.b. QuickTime Player can export an AVI as MOV; be sure to rename the file to .mp4 for Chrome
- n.b. when converting videos, make sure quality and frame rate are as good as the original
**** edit page
- search is always case insensitive
- supports advanced query strings
- entering ~nihil~ in a location field will clear that field
**** search page
- search is always case insensitive
- supports advanced query strings
**** uploads page
- asset importer ignores hidden files and directories
** Styles
*** the =max-width: 300%;= hack on the query input field needs a better solution
**** replace the use of ~level~ with a simple flex row
** Pending
*** display modes: have an option that makes the images really big (single column, huge images)
*** hovering over asset should show larger version in a large tooltip
** Home
*** make the selectors row sticky when scrolling
**** allow =nav= element to scroll away
**** container with selectors and container with tags should be sticky
**** this is difficult because Bulma assumes =is-fixed-top= is for a =nav= at the top
**** trying to squeeze everything into =nav= forces all of the elements onto one row
*** when multiple attributes are selected, add a ~clear all~ button/tag
*** filter years in ~Year~ selector when there are results available
**** that is, find all possible years available among the results, only show those
*** hovering over asset should fetch and display details in a large tooltip
*** display modes
**** grid of 300x300 images with caption info (date, location/filename) (a la PhotoPrism)
**** wide blocks with thumbnails on left, more details on right (c.f. anilist.co)
**** responsive grid; images only, scaled to fit in a row and fill horizontally (i.e. ~mujina~)
**** grid of just images, maybe 180x180; images cropped to the square (a la Apple Photos)
**** list of rows, tiny thumbnail (96x96), caption, location, date
*** navigation rail for filtering assets
**** Nextcloud has a side bar for photos with these options:
***** Photos
***** Videos
***** Albums
***** People
***** Favorites
***** On this day
***** Tags
***** Locations
*** view by ~days~ like Photos.app
**** need a query that groups photos by day
*** calendar view for browsing by months
**** PhotoPrism has a ~calendar~ view that shows months of years in descending order with a random thumbnail
**** clicking on the month opens an "album" of everything in that month
** Details
*** completion for tags (like bulk edit form)
*** completion for location fields (like bulk edit form)
*** clearing a location field is impossible (backend merges all values)
*** add ~copy~ button next to asset path
*** Read timezone info from Exif tags when displaying asset details
**** everything is assuming that the date/time is UTC, which is almost always wrong
**** Exif field is named =OffsetTimeOriginal= in ~primary~
**** frontend should use ~timezone~ value (if available) to show correct time in asset details
*** Format byte size using locale-specific number formatting
*** Show tiny map of where photo was taken
**** [[https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/][Google Maps]]
- customer uses their own API key, sets in preferences
- for =testing= account: =AIzaSyAI73udKC3KVk6aIBqOjSqSv6PEQ0qd638=
**** [[https://mariusandra.github.io/pigeon-maps/][Pigeon Maps]]
- Uses data from OpenStreetMap, Wikimedia for the tiles
*** Find out if =mp4= crate can read GPS coords from videos
**** Preview.app will display location information for videos
*** Show additional file metadata (TIFF, EXIF, JFIF, IPTC)
** Uploads
*** make the uploads form super fancy like https://github.com/Swappea/solid-file-upload
*** theoretically could show the thumbnail of images before uploading
**** c.f. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API/Using_files_from_web_applications
** Edit
*** hover over asset thumbnail will show larger version as tooltip
*** allow adding or subtracting a number of days
*** add option to set the caption
** Pagination
*** turn the ~Page n of m~ text into a button to input a page number
**** clicking the button opens a dropdown with a text input field
**** pressing ~Enter~ or clicking ~Go~ button will dismiss dropdown and go to that page
*** paging alternatives
**** spring-loaded next-page navigation
***** scroll to the bottom and keep trying to scroll
***** show some indication (e.g. a spinner) that holding will fetch the next page
***** after two seconds or so, navigate to the next page
**** consider other ways of showing lots of results w/o paging
***** look at some examples and packages for ideas on design and implementation
****** handles scrolling and waiting for data: https://pub.dev/packages/pagination_view
****** has dots: https://pub.dev/packages/dot_pagination_swiper
****** can show an error message: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_pagination_helper
****** infinite with limited caching: https://pub.dev/packages/infinite_pagination
****** supports various views: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_paginator
**** consider how to display pages continuously (a la infinite list)
***** would keep several pages in the widget tree at one time
***** scrolling would drop a page widget from the tree, and add a new one
***** when fetching a new page, the page widget would show a progress indicator
***** the "dropped" pages would be changed to consist of placeholders to free memory
**** using carousel style navigation arrows?
** Finding/removing duplicates
*** many assets are very similar to each other, probably differ only in metadata
*** find a means (histogram?) of detecting near-duplicates
** Hosting externally
*** consider storage costs (currently under 100 GB)
*** place basic auth server in front (Azure app gateway maybe?)
*** consider deploying in read-only mode (sync would be tricky)
** Attribute management
*** screen for showing all tags, locations, years, mediaTypes, with count values
**** selecting a tag or location offers a rename function
**** selecting multiple tags/locations offers option to remove from all assets
** Deleting assets
*** create graphql mutation to delete assets with certain tag
**** boolean argument ~yes~ to actually perform the delete
**** if ~yes~ argument is false, reports what would be deleted
** Data Format Support
*** PNG files apparently (can) have EXIF data, including orientation, check if this works
*** Read =ID3= tags in audio files
*** Detect time zone offset in EXIF data
According to Wikipedia the 2.31 version of EXIF will support time-zone
information. Eventually, the application should be able to detect this and
include it in the database records.

: There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus
: rendering the stored time ambiguous. However, time-zone information have
: been introduced recently by Exif version 2.31 (July 2016). Related tags are:
: "OffsetTime", "OffsetTimeOriginal" and "OffsetTimeDigitized".

*** Support more video formats
**** OGG (=.ogg=), find out what it is and how to play it
*** Support PDF files
**** Display thumbnail of first page
**** c.f. https://github.com/pdf-rs/pdf_render
**** Display available metadata
*** Render Markdown as HTML in a scrollable view
*** Display anything textual in a scrollable text area
*** HEIC/HEIF images
**** TODO evaluate https://crates.io/crates/libheif-rs
**** HEIF is an image file format employing HEVC (h.265) image coding
**** [[https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/][AV1]] is the free alternative to encumbered HEVC
**** image crate supports AVIF but cannot read HEIC files because they lack AVIF "branding"
***** unclear where the error is coming from, but ultimately cannot read HEIC files at all
** Machine learning
*** facial recognition
**** evaluate how other tools make this easier
***** do they simply show the faces and have the user enter names?
*** https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-tensorflow-rust/
*** TensorFlow Hub: https://tfhub.dev
*** https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/
*** PhotoPrism applies a bunch of keywords to assets, but only one "label"
**** e.g. a "Sheep" label with keywords "animal, grass, grasslands, green"
*** ML to identify objects, people, etc in photos
**** ML recognizes the subject (dog, cat, person, etc)
**** PhotoPrism supports "automated tagging based on Google TensorFlow"
**** could use OpenCV for face recognition
*** ML to rank photos on various qualities
**** c.f. https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/
**** ML assigns scores on aesthetics, interest, etc
** Asset organization
*** Events
**** e.g. school performances, vacations
**** Means of assigning assets to a particular event
**** Browsing by events
*** Albums
**** i.e. organize assets by project, subject, event
**** Apple Photos has ~smart~ albums
***** assets taken around the same time, place
**** save search results as a new album
*** Groups and subgroups of assets
**** Turkey > Gallipoli Peninsula > Gali Winery
**** Winery > vinification > fermentation tanks
**** Architecture > Buildings > underground cellar
*** Find similar images based on their histograms(?)
*** Multiple libraries (like Apple Photos)
** Data Integrity
*** Add a GraphQL mutation that will delete and rebuild all indices
*** Guard against concurrent modifications
**** consider how to manage multiple users making changes
**** e.g. two people trying to update the same set of recent imports
**** e.g. two people trying to edit the same asset
**** this is known as the ~lost update~ problem
**** usually managed with a revision number on the record
***** updates must include the revision number; if mismatch, raise error
***** HTTP uses the =ETag= value and the =If-Match= header for this purpose
**** maybe keep an edit history or revision number in separate records
*** Expose data integrity checks in frontend
**** consider if using GraphQL subscriptions would make sense
***** would return each asset id and success bool or list of error codes
***** results would be returned one at a time for the frontend to show progress
***** the error codes would be encoded as GraphQL enums
**** add an option to purge bad records
***** errors of type base64, utf8, missing are not recoverable
**** find files for which there are no documents
*** Should have automated backups of the database
**** every M operations or T minutes/hours/days
**** retain N copies of the backup
**** use EXAF similar to how zorigami does its database backup
** Bulk Export
*** Easy selection and export of multiple images
** Easy publishing to sharing sites (e.g. Google Photos)
*** option to auto-orient
*** option to resize image
*** option to change format
*** option to strip metadata
*** option to apply watermarks
*** option to save in ePub format for iOS
*** button to open asset in file browser
** Easy import from external sites (e.g. google, instagram)

** Date/Time values
- Everything is treated as UTC
- EXIF data may contain timezone data depending on version
