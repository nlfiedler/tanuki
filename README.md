# Tanuki

A system for importing, storing, categorizing, browsing, displaying, and searching files, primarily images and videos. Attributes regarding the files are stored in a schema-less, document-oriented database. Designed to store millions of files. Provides a simple web interface with basic browsing and editing capabilities.

## Building and Testing

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 8.x or higher
* [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) 0.18 or higher

#### Example for MacOS

This example assumes you are using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to install the dependencies, which provides up-to-date versions of everything needed. The `xcode-select --install` is there just because the command-line tools sometimes get out of date, and some of the dependencies will fail to build without them.

```shell
$ xcode-select --install
$ brew install node
$ brew install elm
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

### Commands

To start an instance configured for development, run the following command.

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm test
$ gulp
```

## Architecture

A bunch of JavaScript running on Node.js, and probably some native code in there somewhere.

### Why Node.js

That is a long story. This application started as a set of Python scripts, then became an Erlang/Nitrogen application, then was rewritten in Elixir on Phoenix. Then, due to changing requirements, was rewritten again in JavaScript on Node.js. The Elm code from the previous generation is the only part that did not change.

### Why Elm

The Elm language compiler and runtime make it nearly impossible to have runtime exceptions. The language is very clean, well defined, easy to learn, and produces fast JavaScript code. Elm data is immutable, leading to safer code. All actions are performed via commands to the runtime, and updates are delivered via messages to the application. This leads to an architecture that scales well with the application. The Elm "time-traveling" debugger makes finding the few mistakes that are made quite easy.

## Design

### Storage

When an asset is added to the system, several steps are performed:

1. A SHA256 checksum of the file contents is computed.
1. An identifier based on the import date/time, filename extension, and [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/javascript) is generated.
1. A minimal document, with checksum and identifier, is stored in the database.
1. The asset is stored in a directory structure according to import date/time.
    - e.g. `2017/05/13/1630/01ce0d526z6cyzgm02ap0jv281.jpg`
    - the minutes are rounded to :00, :15, :30, or :45
    - the base filename is the ULID
    - the original file extension is retained

#### Benefits

* Assets are stored in directory structure reflecting time and order of addition
    - ULID sorts by time, so order of insertion is retained
* Number of directories and files at any particular level is reasonable
    - at most 96 directories per calendar day
    - unlikely to have many files per 15 minute block
* Can rebuild some of the metadata from the directory structure and file names
    - import date/time from file path
    - media type from extension
    - original date/time from file metadata
* Encoded path as asset ID allows serving asset without database lookup
    - base64 encoded asset path happens to be same length as SHA256
* Avoids filename collisions
    - names like `IMG_1234.JPG` easily collide with other devices

#### Drawbacks

The files are renamed, which might be a bother to some people. In many cases, the file names are largely irrelevant, as most are of the form `IMG_1234.JPG`. In other cases, the names are something ridiculous, like `20150419171116-63EK7JXWKEVMDJVV-P1510081.jpg`, which encodes a date/time and some seemingly random sequence of letters and numbers. The good news is the original file name is recorded in the database.

#### Some History

From the very beginning of the project, assets were stored in a directory structure reflecting the checksum, reminiscent of Git. For instance, if the file checksum was `938f831fb02b313e7317c1e0631b86108a9e4a197e33d581fb68be91a3c6ce2f`, then the file would be stored in a directory path `93/8f` with a filename of `831fb02b313e7317c1e0631b86108a9e4a197e33d581fb68be91a3c6ce2f`. Using the checksum as the asset identifier made it very easy to serve the asset without a database lookup.

However, this design had several problems:

* Discarded most information about the asset:
    - file name and extension
    - media type cannot be guessed
    - import date/time
* With only 256 by 256 directories, the files-per-directory scales linearly
    - for 100,000 assets, ~1.5 files in each directory
    - for 1,000,000 assets, ~15 files in each directory
    - for 1,000,000,000 assets, ~15,000 files in each directory
* Looks scary to normal people
